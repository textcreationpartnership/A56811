            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE to the Chriſtian and Peaceable <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that ſeeks the things that be of Chriſt.</head>
            <p>A Zeal for Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion hath overcome all Diſcouragements ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from many Cauſes, and inſpired me to a Boldneſs prevailing againſt much Fear, even to publiſh the ſecret Workings of my Heart. As long as the Church dare ſhew her Face, my Notions are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Light; they can receive no Luſter from my Name: let them go forth in that Light and Power, which the Father of Lights, and the God of Peace hath given, and ſhall give unto them; and if they may but give any Light to diſcover the way of Peace, let me not only ly in Obſcurity, which I love, becauſe fitteſt for me, but be diſgraced by them, who ſpeak all manner of Evil of me. If I have not forſaken, and betrayed the Truth, I have not forſaken nor betrayed the Church; and when you come to ſee the Weapons which I handle, and the Leaders and Authorities which I follow, in the following Treatiſe, as well as the Cauſe for which I plead, I hope you will be convinced, that as far as I have pleaded for the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> Brethren, I have not run from my Colours. There is common Truth, a large and ſpacious ground to take them in, and to build up one and the ſame Fabrick upon it, comfortable to all true Chriſtians, receptive of all the Family of God, and impregnable againſt all their and our Enemies. It is ſome Relief and Comfort to ſee many lift up their Feet, <hi>i. e.</hi> come and view the Deſolations of the Church of Chriſt among us; to be affected with them, and ſome in whom is an excellent Spirit, are contriving to bring the ſeparate Apartments under one Roof, and within one Line and Wall. And theſe do ſtand upon the Rock of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Principles, when not ſupported by the Arm of Fleſh: But no ſooner do Arbitrators move for a Reconciliation, but others do all they can to thruſt them from them, without reſpect to their Perſons, or due Reverence to Truth and Reaſon. He that interpoſeth in this Difference, doth at the Peril of Oppoſition. The R. Rev. Author of the firſt <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> hath found this true; though his Quality and Perſon were more than gueſt at, yet the Epiſcopal Staff could not bear off the Laſhes of ſeveral Junior Writers from the Back of <hi>Naked Truth.</hi> But Truth, be it never ſo naked, can bear Blows and Laſhes, as it hath always born the Violence of Storms and Times: Truth cannot long be confined within Doors, but will appear in open view, whatever its Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be, whether Scorns, Contradictions, Laughter, and Mockery, Abuſes, and Scourgings, or Approbation and Honour. The Appearance of ſuch a Book as that <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> at ſuch a time, was like a Comet, it drew the Eyes of all that could to look upon it; it was a Divine Manifeſtation of a Primitive Chriſtian-Spirit of Love. And certainly, as that pious Endeavour hath encreaſed
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:101841:3"/>his Comforts, ſo he hath not loſt all his Labour; for ſince that, we have had more Overtures of Peace, than we heard of in the many Years of Diſcord and Troubles, from the Learned in the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> have born all the Blame, and Scorn, and Sufferings of our Diviſions; and have offered as much towards Peace and Accommodation as was poſſible for them to offer. But partly their Writings, and the doleful State of Religion, have drawn out ſome Wiſhes and Conceſſions from ſome Men of Eminency in the Church, towards Peace and Accommodation. And tho theſe as yet ſeem too little, yet there is much to be gathered from them; firſt, as to their Propenſity to Peace. <hi>2.</hi> The Influence which their Conceſſions may have upon auſterer Tempers.
<hi>3.</hi> Becauſe they being ſatisfied in the Point of Conformity, as to their own Practice, do yet for a greater Good and Peace incline to a Comprimiſe. The Learned Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hath, with ſubmiſſion to Authority, made ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals; and I hope would yield to more, if the Compoſure were put into his hand. Even Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> who is currantly thought to have writen the Defence of Dr.
<hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 103.</note> doth wiſh with all his Heart, that ſome Expreſſions were altered, to prevent any Scandal to the ſcrupulous, or to the profane; this he writes only for the Office of Burial of the Dead, which he calls an excellent Office, ſuppoſing the due Exerciſe of Church-Diſcipline, to caſt all notorious Sinners and Schiſmaticks out of the Communion of the Church, which the Church ſuppoſeth to be done. I am of his Mind,<note place="margin">Pag. 102.</note> concerning the Excellency of that Office; It is moſt comfortable to the Miniſter, and moſt Comfort to all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when we can uſe it upon good Evidences concerning the Dead. But as the viſiting of the Sick hath been too often to me, the moſt uncomfortable Office of my Miniſtry; ſo it hath been a great Addition of Sorrow, to commit thoſe Bodies to the Earth, concerning whom I had no hope of their reſting in Chriſt. O what dejecting Stories could I write of too many! but I forbear. If he be ſo ſenſible of the ill uſe which may be made of that excellent Office, and do ſo heartily wiſh, that ſome Expreſſions were altered to prevent Scandal to the ſcrupulous and prophane; methinks for the ſame Reaſons he might wiſh more Alterations might be made, in other things, and Offices. Moſt frank and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous are thoſe Expreſſions of the Right Reverend and Pious Biſhop of <hi>Cork;</hi>

               <q rend="margQuotes">We are ready to ſacrifice all we can otherwiſe (<hi>i.e.</hi> without Schiſm) to the publick Peace and Safety; what moſt of the Diſſenters would be at (no Liturgy, no Epiſcopacy, no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity) may not be, cannot be without Schiſm, <hi>p. 32.</hi> The only Steps by which we can mutually move to Peace, I with all ſubmiſſion conceive to be theſe: <hi>1.</hi> That we all would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſtudy Self-denial, and that with a peculiar Eye and regard to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation; one perhaps of Popularity, another of a particular Humor, another of ſomewhat elſe.

I do not conceive ſuch Relaxation as this would break the Harmony and Beauty of our Worſhip, or diſturb the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Peace of our Church. There are ſome Collects, and perhaps ſome Rubricks too, which with all duty and ſubmiſſion I humbly conceive might be altered for the better.</q> pag.
<hi>118, 119.</hi> This honourable Embaſſador of Peace ſpeaks home, and from his heart, and ſhall for ever ſit high in the eſteem of all the Sons of Peace. Here are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals (conditional indeed, with the conſent of Authority, as they ſhould be) that will certainly be imbraced by Diſſenters. But now, if the Church ſhould conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, (if I may call that a Condeſcenſion which is done for Chriſt?) as far as it can without Schiſm; and the Diſſenters as far as they can with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: What ſhall be done if they cannot come up to a full and perfect cloſure? Shall the Diſſenter have no benefit by his Conſent to the great things? and the greateſt number of things (in which they agree already) ſhall he be not only excluded, but puniſhed, altho he continue peaceable in his Diſſent? In ſuch a caſe, here is an apparent Neceſſity of mutual Forbearance in Love, and of the Bond of Peace, to keep in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit. And here I cannot without a great reſpect to another Conformiſt of Worth and Quality, (as I am informed) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Words, which are like a healing Plaiſter to a heart bruiſed between our grating Differences.
<q rend="margQuotes">The way to make National Religion moſt National, is by comprehending all the Differences that can be reconciled with true Religion; while they that diſſent in ſome things, receive one another, with a good, peaceable, holy and publick Temper of Mind; as the great Argument and Inducement of which, we ſhould all pray for the Acceptance of the holy Service of all that call on the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes Chriſtians, but immediately unites them again) both theirs and ours; they and we, whatever ſmaller Diſtinctions make the <hi>[They]</hi> and the <hi>[We]</hi> are both one in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: We ought to pray for the common Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all ſo united, though not bound up in the ſame common Form with us, for a gracious Audience and Reception of their and our Worſhip of God, that ſo the Spirit of Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in the main, may convey all our Services into one before God, where indeed (if they are as he requires) they meet ſtript of all their outward Circumſtances, Form and Ceremony: Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being alone able to mount thither with them. And Services ſo raiſed, can by no means be ſpared for ſmall Differences in a National Religious Intereſt; for the Angels of all ſuch, behold the Face of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven.

The Elector promiſed his releaſe, if <hi>Anne</hi> his Ducheſs would be willing, and deſired him to try her firſt: ſhe replied according to her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, <hi>If ſhe lived, he ſhould not be releaſed.</hi> Which Anſwer of hers, the <hi>Lantgrave,</hi> and other wiſe Men, did thus interpret, <hi>That the Dutcheſs ſhould ſhortly dy,</hi> that <hi>Peucer</hi> by her Death might be releaſed; and ſo it proved, according to their Interpretation, ſhe died, ſaith Dr.
<hi>Peucer,</hi> in that very moment, in which I dreamed in my Sleep, of a great and noble Funeral, and a Bell ringing, and as the Bell-rope brake, that Verſe of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> came into my Mind, <hi>Our Soul is eſcaped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowler; the Snare is broken, and we are eſcaped.</hi> And among what Prodigies, ſhe died, is known to all.</p>
            <p>I am confident, if the Perſecutors of our peaceable and religious Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:101841:4"/>were ſtudious to prepare for Death, they would forbear this Work; and as it is dreadful for any of them to dy in their Sins, unrepented of, and to dy in this Sin, ſo let them take heed, that ſome of the greateſt of them do not fall by an apparent Hand of God. I do profeſs if I had any Friend engaged in this horrid Work, I would perſwade him, if poſſible, to forbear, if he had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Soul, to his Life, to his Family and Poſterity; if any true Loyalty to his Soveraign, if kindneſs to the Church and Country; for this is a fighting againſt God, a walking contrary to him; and what can they expect but that God ſhould walk contrary to them? Well, we read, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> for any part of Righteouſneſs and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but there's none for them that perſecute. Bleſſed are they who lay to heart the doleful State of the Proteſtant Religion, that conſult her Peace, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for her Peace in this day of her Fear and Trouble. When other are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Wo to themſelves, and Wo to others; theſe will find Peace in their own Souls, who have ſtudied the Peace of the Church, by healing her Breaches. If any ſhould ſay to the firſt movers of this Work now in hand, as <hi>Olivarius</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> when in great Terrors, ſaid to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain: Ah, ah, Cardinalis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pavel. Mellif. Hiſt. <hi>Part</hi> 3. p. 343. <hi>Edit.</hi> 4. Anno 1631.</note> 
               <hi>tu nos omnes in aeternum exitium trahis:</hi> it will be no allay of Horrors, nor relief to Conſcience, if any Divine or Confeſſor ſhall ſay, as the Cardinal did to him; You are tempted of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit, perſist in the Faith. To this fearful Story, I will add the words of that Hiſtorian, <hi>Haec eſt merces Judicum quibus Aulicae Gratiae fumus, ſua Conſcientia potior eſt:</hi> He might have added, <hi>&amp; omnium,</hi> and of all that prefer Court-Favour, which is but Smoak, to the Light and Peace of their own Conſciences. The Sufferers are much to be pitied; the divided Body of Chriſt is more to be pitied, but they who ſtretch out their Hands to vex the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and truly pious Sufferers, are both to be feared and pittied; becauſe it is a more fearful thing for them to fall into the Hands of the living God, than for them, who religiouſly fear God, to fall into their Hands. To put an end to the Sufferings of true Proteſtants in a Proteſtant Kingdom, and to prevent an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and feared Deſolation, good Mens Thoughts are at work, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propoſals for Accommodation are made publick. And I wonder at the Providence of God, that when too many are extream buſy with Hands and Tongues to tear us into more and new Diſtractions, others, and they Members of the Church-Communion, appear as ſtrongly prepared to receive the Ejected. What this Providence may ſpeak, I will not be ſo bold as to interpret, but it raiſeth up ſome hopes, when we are dejected under the dejecting Apprehenſions of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Men. It is manifeſt, that moſt that are engaged in ſuppreſſing the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> read little, conſider as little, it is but vain to write for their ſakes; and thoſe that read a little of much that is ſaid, are ſtrongly pre-engaged, or are afraid, or covetous to ſave themſelves, or carried by ſome other Affection
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:101841:5"/>and Temptation, and thatwhich is moſt fearful of all, are under a ſtrong Deluſion. If we were not under ſome degrees of a Deluſion, it were impoſſible that Men ſhould be ſo impolitick, and irreligious. I am grieved, and aſhamed to read how <hi>Gundamor</hi> did delude a great, wiſe, and Proteſtant Kingdom (in his Account of his Embaſſy to the Council in <hi>Spain</hi>) in two great Inſtances of his Craft, pernitious to our Church and State. <hi>1.</hi> A Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſaid

But now many are ſo impoſed upon, as tho they did not believe what they cannot but believe, and as if they believed what they have no reaſon to ſuſpect. O that many both of our Preachers and Proſecutors would diligently read and conſider, that excellent Sermon of our renowned Father Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> on <hi>Mat. 9.

<q rend="margQuotes">O lift up your Eyes and conſider how the Hearts of your Brethren ly waſte without Inſtruction, without Knowledg, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Food of Life, without the Comfort of God's Word! ſuch a Miſery as was never ſeen among Heathens.

<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:101841:5"/>and Preachers —. But when God taketh away his Miniſters which ſhould preach Peace and open to the People the Will of God, and make known his Judgments, it is a Token that God is highly diſpleaſed with his People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> I may be blamed for this Quotation, as if it were ſcandalous to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a popular deluſion of People to Diſcontent: Yes, I know what may be ſaid; but let the doleful, dark, famiſhing Condition of multitudes of Places in this Kingdom be view'd; and it is true, that People periſh for want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. I have known where one pitiful Curat (Journy-man indeed) that could make but a poor ſhift to ſaw the Liturgy and Pſalms between him and the Clerk, hath been all that three great Congregations had had, unleſs a Stranger had preached to two of them in one day. The want of Maintenance is very great in all Parts of the Kingdom; but the want of Miniſters, of ſound, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, plain, edifying, faithful Miniſters, is exceeding great, and far greater. I cannot but pity, and ſpeak of what I know, by good report, ſuch hath been the hunger and want of Spiritual Bread in large Places, that poor Souls that go conſtantly to Common-Prayer, have crouded into the Prayers, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Preaching, or Exhortations of a <hi>Nonconformiſt.</hi> O how painfully have I ſeen poor Souls travel on foot ſeveral Miles to hear a profitable Sermon from ſome Conformiſt! Nonconformity and Conformity is a Myſtery to poor Souls; they can wave the Diſtinction, for their Profit and Edification. Good Preaching is as ſcarce as Gold in many poor Countries, and more precious: Poor Souls are never the better for ſome Miniſters, and a great deal the worſe for others; ſome have not, and care not for the Study of the great Gift of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gonverſion and Salvation; ſome may do better than they do, but will not, tho they may; and many others that can and would, may not. O what's the State of millions of precious Souls in the mean time! I know
<hi>London,</hi> and other great Places, have plenty of that, as of other Rarities: but if the Scarcity of Countries were but known, and laid to heart, methinks we ſhould not ſtand ſo ſtrictly upon Terms, and I am certain, ſhould ſend out all we can find into the Harveſt, rather than ſilence, and keep out one, or what is much worſe, than ſend the Servants of God, his Stewards, to dig and beg, to ſet the verieſt Catch-Poles upon Earth, the Lions, the abſurd and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men, that have not ſo much Faith as Devils have, to watch for them to arreſt them; firſt, leiſurely to undo them, and afterwards to apprehend them, and caſt them into Priſon: To ſtop the Mouths of able and faithful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to impriſon them for their Labours, is to let Hell looſe in a Nation; and to ſtop the way to Heaven againſt many Souls. O <hi>Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem!</hi> O

            <p>The Debates are principally for and againſt Forms and Ceremonies. For both, I make bold to ſay;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1.</hi> There is great Reaſon why a ſingular regard ought to be bad, and given to the King's Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, for the Wiſdom, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Comprehenſiveneſs of it; and becauſe, if ever ſuch a thing may come to be offered, we may hope for the Royal Approbation of what may be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of it, of which he ſeem'd ſo fond, when he promiſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2.</hi> It is clear, that Cathedrals muſt not be touched, neither Revenues, nor Ceremonies, let them enjoy both, and allow unto others a Liberty in another kind, while they may enjoy theirs, without mutual and uncharitable Cenſures and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3.</hi> It is clear, there muſt be a Liturgy; and very many, even to Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> mention ſome Alterations in the ſeveral Parts of it, as deſirable and adviſable, without any poſitive Arrogance in a Matter of this Nature. I do offer my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, Some that expect much Profit by Preaching, do think firſt and ſecond Service too long, and tireſome: Others that care leſs for Preaching, are very buſy in the Interlocutory Parts of the Service, grow careleſs, and too often prate (and ſtare about and whiſper) in the Leſſons, and ſleep under our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; both are too long for them alſo. And in ſome Congregations, there are,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:101841:6"/>I believe, as many, if not more, Service-Books, than Bibles, which, under Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is too little honour for the Bible. All that I will ſuggeſt in this laſt Caſe is, <hi>1.</hi> That the ſecond Service, or Communion-Service, may be then only read, when there is a Communion, or when there is no Sermon. Except the reading the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments be frequently enjoined; or, that it may be left at liberty to reade ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt, or ſecond, or what parts of both may beſt ſuit with particular Occaſions and Aſſemblies. <hi>2.</hi> That only one of the three Creeds be uſed at one time, in the ſame Scrvice. <hi>3.</hi> The ſo oftenrepetition of the Lord's Prayer in the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may he limited. All cannot, moſt do not keep Curats; the work of Reading the ordinary firſt and ſecond Service, beſides incidental Offices, as Baptiſms, Churchings, &amp;c. make it very expenſive to most Mens ſtrength and ſpirits, and weariſom to the People: and the conſtant neceſſary work of Preaching and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing is hardly endured by the young and healthful, but impoſſible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the infirm and aged. It is true indeed, if a Man's Conſcience will bear it, and the People have no more need, a Miniſter may be both ſhort, and ſeldom in the Pulpit; but then it is with two great Hazzards: Firſt, of loſing his Auditory, or of his Auditories great loſs to their Souls. If we did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Copiouſneſs of our Work, the frequent Repetitions, Ingeminations, and Enforcements of many great and neceſſary Arguments, the Succeſſion and Growth of young Ones, and all theſe of ſeveral Capacities, if Preaching be at all neceſſary to the Inſtruction, Converſion, Correction, Direction, Conſolation, and Salvation of precious Souls, it may not be intermitted without far greater loſs than a Maſters Abſence from his School, or a careful Father, Mother, or Steward, from the Houſhold. This humble Propoſal for omitting the ſecond Service, hath a fair Countenance from the Rubricks. There is a Suppoſition, that the Communion is celebrated every Lord's day (but it is not, except in ſome few Cathedrals) as appears by ſome Rubricks; Rubr. the laſt, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the Lord's Prayer, is this;
<q rend="margQuotes">The Table at the Communion-time, having a fair white Linnen Cloth upon it, ſhall ſtand in the Body of the Church, or in the Chancel, where Morning and Evening Prayer are appointed to be ſaid: and the Prieſt ſtanding at the North-ſide of the Table, ſhall ſay the Lord's-Prayer, with the Collect following, the People kneeling.</q> Now I query, Whether the Prieſt be bound to read that Service, but ſtanding at the North-ſide of the Table, ſo placed, ſo covered, to anſwer the Title of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which is, The Order for the Adminiſtration of the Lord's Supper, or Holy Communion: And the Rubricks that follow ſpeak altogether in relation to the Communion; the Rubrick after the Commandments is,
<q rend="margQuotes">Then ſhall follow one of theſe two Collects for the King, the Prieſt ſtanding as before, and ſaying, Let us pray —.</q> The Rubrick, after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, doth ſuppoſe the Communion to be celebrated every Lord's-day; or elſe we omit to declare Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, Bans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is a great Inconſiſtency in that Clauſe of that Rubrick, and then if occaſion be, ſhall notice be given of the Communion: when the former
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:101841:7"/>Rubricks ſuppoſe there is one then. The Rubrick before the Prayer for the whole State of Chriſt's Church is, <hi>And when there is a Communion, the Prieſt ſhall then place upon the Table ſo much Bread and Wine, as he ſhall think ſufficient: After which done, the Prieſt ſhall ſay, Let us pray for the whole State of Chriſt's Church.</hi> I know there is a Rubrick after the Communion Service, that appoints what ſhall be read, when there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: which makes a Communion-Service, without a Communion.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general for the Things to be done.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Thing is the Terms of Admiſſion to the Adminiſtration. For this one plain Rule may be ſufficient, taken out of the Form of Ordination: That which is a ſufficient Condition, or requiſite for Ordination and Admiſſion to the Office, is ſufficient for the Adminiſtration. Or that which is ſufficient to make a Man a Miniſter, is enough to entitle him to the Exerciſe of his Miniſtry, except he apoſtatize, and loſe what he ſeem'd to have. The Perſon to be ordained or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted is firſt to be tried and examined. The Qualifications to be tried are his Calling, and his Qualifications, or ſitneſs for the Office, by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>The Qualifications for Learning, are (low enough, and were high enough,<note place="margin">Rubr. for a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</note> if not too high, for the greatest Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at our first Reformation) learned in the Latin Tongue, and ſufficiently inſtructed in the holy Scripture. The Biſhop doth admoniſh him, that preſents any One to the Office, to preſent ſuch as be apt and meet for their Learning and Godly Converſation: and if there be no impediment or not able Crime objected by the Congregation, he is admitted, upon his taking the Oath of Supremacy, and anſwering to the Queſtions; <hi>I.</hi> That he doth trust that he is inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take his Office.
<hi>II.</hi> Truly called according to the Will of Christ. <hi>III.</hi> That he doth unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe all the Canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament. <hi>IV.</hi> That he will diligently read the ſame unto the People, where he ſhall be appointed to ſerve. <hi>V.</hi> That he will apply all his Diligence to faſhion his Life according to the Doctrine of Christ. <hi>VI.</hi> Reverently to obey his Ordinary. Over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe Anſwers, he that is to be ordained Priest, declares VIIly, that he is perſuaded, that the holy Scriptures contain ſufficiently all Doctrines required of neceſſity for eternal Salvation through Faith in Jeſus Christ, and hath ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God's Grace out of the ſaid Scriptures, to inſtruct the People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Charge, and to teach nothing as neceſſary to Salvation, but what may be concluded and proved by the Scriptures. <hi>VIII.</hi> That he will give faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diligence always to miniſter the Doctrine, Sacraments, and Diſcipline of Christ, as the Lord commanded. <hi>IX.</hi> That he will baniſh all erroneous and ſtrange Doctrines; uſe publick and private Monitions, to the Sick and Whole.
<hi>X.</hi> That he will be diligent in reading the Scriptures, and in Studies, laying aſide the Study of the World and Fleſh. <hi>XI.</hi> Frame his Life, and the Life of his Family, according to the Doctrine of Christ, and be Examples to the Flock.
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:101841:7"/>
               <hi>XII.</hi> That he will maintain and promote Quietneſs, Peace and Love among all Chriſtian People, eſpecially his charge. <hi>XIII.</hi> That he will obey his Ordinary, and chief Miniſters, to whom is committed the Charge and Government over them.</p>
            <p>Now I do ſuppoſe that Subſcriptions will be required of all Admitted;<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Humphr.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Union. And the Samaritan.</note> and the last Promiſe will be moſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled. Of this ſome Non-Conformiſts declare their Readineſs to obey the Biſhops, as Officers under the King, as ſupream Governour; and is alſo propoſed by others.<note place="margin">Matter of Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For the Subſcription, (which is but ſome kind of Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſpecially in doubtful and controverted Things) <hi>Query,</hi> If for Peace ſake it may not be ſufficient, if, after due Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Qualifications, and Calling by the Holy Ghost, that they declare and ſubſcribe their unfeigned Belief of all the Canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament; that they contain all Doctrine required of neceſſity for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, and that they will inſtruct the People, committed to their Charge, (or any other, to whom they may occaſionally preach) and teach nothing, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of neceſſity to eternal Salvation, but that which they may be perſuaded may be concluded and proved by the holy Scripture; and that they will diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully perform all Parts of their Office, and order their own Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and of their Families, (if they have any, or when they ſhall have) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of Christ?</p>
            <p>We ſee upon what Terms Miniſters are ordained; What more ſhould be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, as Miniſters, but a Diſcharge of their Miniſtry, according to their Trust, with Knowledg, Diligence and Fidelity? If a Magiſtrate, or any other Officer, be made, he may execute his Office, without any After-Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>If Subſcription to the Articles be ſtill required, for Satisfaction of forreign Churches concerning our Doctrine and Faith, <hi>ut certius inde conſtet omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Eccleſiarum concentus,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote to the Protector: and as a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary to our ſelves, for Peace ſake, as ſome would have our Articles to be; the Number of them are leſſen'd in ſome Propoſals, and expedients thought upon, for the Relief of ſuch, as ſcruple to ſubſcribe, without a fair Expoſition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Articles, and Analogy of Faith, as in the Bill of Comprehenſion.</p>
            <p>The Ceremonies being either aboliſhed, or left at liberty, according to the King's Declaration, the Subſcription, now required by the Canon, ceaſeth; and ſuch as this above mention'd may take place, which is taken out of the Book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. If it be objected, That this large Subſcription is too lax, Socinians and Hereticks may creep in, notwithſtanding this. Anſw. So they will, and ſo they may, and ſo they have, notwithſtanding the preſent Subſcription, or any other, in what term almoſt ſoever. But their Orthodoxy may be tried upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and certified by ſuch as know them perſonally, and that Evil may be
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:101841:8"/>prevented, or remedied when it is divulged: Why ſhall others be preſſed beyond what they can clearly conſent unto, for the ſake of them that will ſubſcribe to any thing?</p>
            <p>By binding them to other, and much ſcrupled Subſcriptions, according to the Canons and new Declarations (except that againſt Tranſubſtantiation, which is a point of Faith, and not to be omitted) we ſee many are un-made in effect, who had been made Miniſters before. This that is ſaid, is not to the Prejudice of their orderly legal Entrance into Cures, by Officers appointed, nor all that may be ſaid.</p>
            <p>This, and whatever elſe, I have thought of, is from a holy Deſire of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling Differences, of univerſal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, if poſſible (but that being morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible) then of a brotherly peaceable Forbearance, which is a great Duty of the Goſpel; and for a Ceſſation of the great Troubles of our Brethren, which is of pernitious Operation, and will reach further than themſelves. And if it might be conſidered, that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Forbearance are of greater Moment, and more clearly revealed and enjoyned, than the things that diſunite us, it might abate our Rigors, and heal our Diviſions. It is true, Obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates is a clear and neceſſary Duty, but it is reſtrained to things antecedently lawful, and practicable: But when the Lawfulneſs of the things are debated, the refuſal of Obedience, contains no Guilt of Rebellion; the Magiſtrates Power, to require Obedience in lawful things is not gain-ſaid, but the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired are rationally doubted of. And when things are urged principally upon the reaſon of Authority, it is clear there is little or nothing in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to commend them to our Obſervation. And the Magiſtrate ſaves his Authority, and is as much obey'd as need be, by making a new Law, that takes off the Obligation of the old, or leaves things indifferent, in their Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, as much as by an Obedience to the old.</p>
            <p>But againſt all that is or can be ſaid, it is objected, That the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> have brought all this Miſchief upon themſelves, and danger to the Church, and Proteſtant Intereſt; for time was (meaning the <hi>Savoy</hi> Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>1661.</hi>) when the Biſhops might have been perſwaded to yield to many Mittigations; but ſome of them, now Diſſenters, anſwered to the Queſtion, What would you have? All or none. And ſo they have one part of their Choice.</p>
            <p>But as this tends to aggravate their Sufferings; ſo good Nature and Grace encline us to relieve them, whoſe Wilfulneſs hath brought them to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of relief, or ſuffering. But what if neither ſome, nor all of them, were guilty of the Stifneſs and Raſhneſs imputed to them? then God calls aloud upon thoſe Inſtruments that are yet alive, by the many Sufferings of good Miniſters and People, and by apparent Dangers of the Proteſtant Religion, both to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves before God, and to make Supplication to him, and Interceſſion for them, with the Supream Power: For if great detriment come to the Goſpel,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:101841:8"/>and to many Souls, by deſtroying the Shepherds, and ſcattering the Flock, it is doubtful whether that Allegation will paſs for an Excuſe, or Plea, that they are Non-Conformiſts and Diſſenters; except they could produce a Warrant from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, deputing them to make ſuch, Conditions. I would not for all the Preferments in the Church, charge any falſely, as being Authors of theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years Troubles, and would ſooner beg Forgiveneſs and repent, than perſiſt in an Errour, or do wrong to the Innocent. I have rather acquitted the Non-Conformiſts from the Blame of drawing theſe Evils upon themſelves, than ſome of the other ſide. And, I think, I have as good Warrant for it, as can be deſired by one that was not preſent at the whole Tranſaction. I am not ſingular in my Opinion; I find an ingenuous Gentleman lay the Fault of our Diſcompoſures upon ſome old <hi>peeviſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Appendix to Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as he calls them. I have been long poſſeſſed with an Opinion alſo, by the Words of the Presbyterian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, in the Concluſion of their Account of thoſe Proceedings, in their last Reply.
<q rend="margQuotes">For all the rest we thank you —. And we must ſay in the Concluſion, that, if theſe be all the Abatements and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you will admit, you ſell your Innocency and the Churches Peace for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</q> If the Pride, Faction, or Raſhneſs of any one, or more, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who deſired a Reformation, had precipitated him into Diſputation, and Contention, or a Refuſal of reaſonable Mitigations; why ſhould others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Indiſcretion of one? and why had not the other Side, who were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in Friends, and highest in Favour, and either advanced, or near an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement into the highest Watch-Tower, condeſcended to ſome Things, that might be grateful to all moderate Men, and no just Offence to many others, and taken the Way for a laſting Peace, and ſo comprehenſive a Settlement, that true Labourers might have been their Fellow-Labourers. I ſhall not in haſte forget the ſorrowful Complaint of a very wiſe and learned Conforming Divine, that could ſay as much to all Points of Conformity, as most, if not any of them all. <hi>The Way of Peace we have not known.</hi> I hear his Fears multiply with his Years, and grow heavy upon him with his great Age. But upon whomſoever the Blame of our Breaches may fall, (as may appear, when a faithful Hiſtory of that Conference may ſee the Light, which I hope to ſee in convenient Time.) A great Duty lies upon all true Proteſtants, by Prayers, Counſels, and all kind of Endeavours, to heal our Breaches, to procure Liberty to the ſound and able Preachers of the Word of Life, and that neither they, nor any that fear God, and worſhip him in Truth, may become a Prey to them that commonly profane God's great Name, ſeldom worſhip him in Publick, and never took
<hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Reſolution for himſelf and his Houſe, that can be ſeen by their Practice: and this every Man will do, whoſe Heart is ruled by the Peace of God.</p>
            <p>I cannot end, but muſt take the Freedom to ſpeak a few Words more, eſpecially to my Conformable Brethren in the Miniſtry, and Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
            <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:101841:9"/>
            <p>I have laboured (reverend Brethren) to raiſe a Building (if you will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to look into it) capacious to hold all or most of our diſſenting Brethren, who now ly out of Doors, and ſtrong to endure all the Batteries of our Adverſaries, upon the Doctrines of our famous Biſhops and Doctors, as upon a Foundation. I am certain I have miſquoted none of them, nor forced them from their Native Sence and Coherence: If I have failed in my arguings, and kept not to the Line of Reaſon, that must be diſcovered by ſharper Lights than mine is, and by thus doing, a <hi>Conformiſt</hi> may plead for the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and not forſake the Church. I have alſo thought that if the ſame Methods and Mediums were uſed for healing our Diviſions, which were propoſed to reconcile, or at least to cool the far greater Controverſies between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and
<hi>Calviniſts,</hi> by our famous and reverend Biſhops, <hi>Morton, Hall, Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. we had ſeen the Kingdom of Chriſt gone up apace, as the Temple did, without the Noice of Axes and Hammers.</p>
            <p>I am perſuaded the Diviſions of the Church ly near the Hearts of ſome of you: and it cannot but be grievous to ſee into what Hands our Brethren are fallen, as given to the Spoil, and I know the Chriſtian Saying, as I received it from credible Teſtimony, that my Lord of <hi>L.</hi> and
<hi>C.</hi> anſwered a buſy Extinguiſher of Light, who told him, Dr.
<hi>G.</hi> was preaching. <hi>He is about his Maſter's Work, let him alone:</hi> &amp; again, <hi>Preaching and praying are good Works:</hi> Where there is an Antipathy against Popery, there is Moderation to Proteſtant Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>I humbly beſeech you, Chriſtian Gentlemen (Juſtices of the Peace) bear with me a Word or two. Do you think if peaceable Non-Conformity be not fit to be indulged, nor ſpared, will Non-Conformity and Hereſy, meeting in the ſame Perſon, be indured, if it be poſſible to root it up? All the Diſputations againſt Non-Conformity now, may be ſtrong Arguments againſt the Toleration of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, (as our Religion is called by the Papiſts) and they who ſtretch their Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Proteſtants for Non-Conformity, do juſtify the Roman Cruelties, and prove their Proceedings to be more rational, and you, that ſtrive with the Flat or Back of the Sword, may be ſmitten with the Edge, if you can endure; and you must take it patiently, or be ſelf-condemned.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, Gentlemen, conſider who they are that run and ride up and down upon this Work, that would take Miniſters and Hearers, but ſuch whoſe Sacraments are Healths, filled with Wine void of the Spirit, whoſe Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Dam-mees:</hi> Will theſe ever reform a Church, that make the World the worſe? Muſt not that Execution of Law be thought unhappy, which is effectually the putting one of
<hi>Contzen</hi> the Jeſuite's Rules into Execution, (as above ſaid) for changing of Religion, and bringing in Popery, viz. to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Severity of Laws and Puniſhments</hi> againſt Proteſtants?</p>

<hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſays in his Preface to <hi>Biſhop Wilkin</hi>'s <hi>15 Sermons,</hi> lately publiſhed; where, in Vindication of that rarely accompliſhed Biſhop, (whoſe great Name, and excellent Spirit it ſeems could not eſcape a ſmutting from ſome of our Fire-brands) He thus defends both the Vertue of <hi>Moderation,</hi> and that great Example of it, to wit: <hi>And I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely</hi> (ſays the Dean) <hi>mention his</hi> Moderation, <hi>and likewiſe adventure to commend him for it; notwithſtanding that this Vertue, ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and magnified by wiſe Men in all Ages, hath of late been declamed againſt with ſo much Zeal and Fierceneſs, and yet with that good Grace and Confidence, as if it were not only no Vertue, but even the Sum and Abridgment of all Vices: I ſay, notwithſtanding all this, I am ſtill of the old Opinion, that</hi> Moderation <hi>is a</hi> Vertue, <hi>and one of the peculiar Ornaments and Advantages of the excellent Conſtitution of our Church, and muſt at laſt be the Temper of her Members, eſpecially the</hi> Clergy, <hi>if ever we ſeriouſly intend the firm Eſtabliſhment of this</hi> Church, <hi>and do not induſtriouſly deſign, by cheriſhing Heats and Diviſions among our ſelves, to let in Popery at theſe Breaches.</hi> But more eſpecially conſider our bleſſed Saviour teacheth us Moderation by his Laws concerning theſe Matters in Difference, by his Apoſtles, by his eaſy Yoke, his Bleſſings and his Judgments; and by a viſible Providence over our chief City <hi>London,</hi> which ſhould be an Example to <hi>Norwich, Briſtol, Coventry,</hi> and a Warning to them. There was nothing to be done in the Year of the dreadful Plague: The Magiſtrate found other Work the next Year after the dreadful Fire: two Years after, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fell into the Hands of Sr. <hi>W.

And how much happier was his Year, and of the Succeſſors of Sir <hi>S. Sterling,</hi> than that troubleſome Year to the Nonconformiſts, and certainly as little comfortable as it was honourable to himſelf. Sir <hi>Richard Ford</hi> was feared, but his eminent Prudence procured him Honour and Eſtimation; And what Conſpiracies or Seditions were moved as much as to make him thoughtful about them? What Cauſe of Suſpicion or Fear did the Diſſenters give his honourable Succeſſors, till the breaking out of the dreadful Plot? and did not the Lord Mayors ſince that, rest confident in the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Fidelity of the Diſſenters? and did not two of them concur in the Vote, against the Proſecution of them? And ſince the Presbyterian Sham-plots have
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:101841:10"/>made even Hardineſs and Impudence, to bluſh at their Confidence, what Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions have they moved to give any Colour for them? How dear was Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience Ward</hi> to all good Men, as appeared in their publick and private Prayers for him in his dangerous Sickneſs? and did not he leave his Government in a peaceable, ſafe State? After ſeveral Years Indulgence of the Non-Conformiſts, did they grow trouble ſome by their Numbers, or factious by their Eaſe? And I do heartily wiſh the R. H. Sir <hi>John More,</hi> now L. Mayor, may leave it as he found it; and carry a Peace in his Boſom, anſwerable to the Piety and Moderation of his Speech at his Election, (for which I know <hi>many Prayers were made for him, by ſome that never ſaw him</hi>) that his Piety may not be outdar'd by ſome of an imperious Humour, to impoſe upon others an impious notion,<note place="margin">I do humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Sermon againſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: to which I ſet my Seal.</note> That Men cannot be Conſcientious, but they muſt be Factious, and take Pleaſure, or Pride, or ſomething elſe, in repreſenting. <hi>peaceable Religion as a Torch of Rebellion.</hi> What tender Heart will be able to bear the Stings of Conſcience, for touching ſuch as fear God, with but the Point of the Sword, for profeſſing that ſame ſubſtantial Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which they hope to be ſaved themſelves. <hi>Dureſce, dureſce.</hi> Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Iſrael.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Conformiſt's Third Plea</hi> FOR THE NON-CONFORMISTS.</head>
            <p>WE may think a Suſpenſion of Severity, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Interpoſition between the Threatning and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, would be proper and ſeaſonable, of great Service and Advantage; but the infinitely wiſe God, Saviour, and King of his Church, whoſe Thoughts are deep and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, may think it ſufficient, that they that love him have his Promiſe, that all things ſhall work together for good to them. Let them that are inſtructed to know his Will, do it, and that know his Promiſes, believe him, and that have renounced the World, freely part with their ſmall ſhare in it. But to me the ſtate of things appears dark, confuſed, and diſconſolate; and being engaged further than I thought at firſt, the ſame Motives that prevailed with me before, prevail'd with me to go on, not from a private or factious Diſcontent, but to prevent, as much as I can, the horrid Sins of ſome, and the greivous Sufferings of others, and to diſcharge mine own Duty, which will bring the greateſt Peace, to my now grieved, broken, and afflicted Spirit.</p>
            <p>But to come to ſome ſpecial matter; give me favour to run over theſe four things.</p>

            <p n="1">I. We are a moſt ſinful, and ſinfully divided Generation, ſo broken, that none but God can keep us from falling to pieces, like a Pot-ſheard broken, like a broken earthen Veſſel, in which there is no pleaſure. Our Reaſon cannot propoſe, nor conſult Expedients to make us whole and happy, becauſe Intereſts, worldly Policy, and a contemptible Art, or private Cunning to get, or ſave, the things that periſh in their uſe, and by their Abuſe undo and ruine the Owners, doth ſtir up Sedition in our Paſſions againſt our Reaſons. The Goſpel hath been ſo generally deſpiſed, that it hath not begotten in us a Faith and Love that unites to Chriſt, and to one another: We have not Faith enough to purify our Hearts, to overcome the World, to act as for a Crown of Glory, and a Kingdom that cannot be moved. If we believed a World to come, how little ſhould we ſtrive for this! If we had Love enough to cover a multitude of Sins, to forgive one another, to love as Brethren, and our Neighbour as our ſelves, we ſhould not be ſo jealous and ſuſpicious, nor contentious, nor ſelfiſh, as we are. One great thing is wanting, which is the Wiſdom from above, deſcribed by St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 3.17. <hi>Which is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality, without Hypocriſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a great Reproach caſt upon the Church, and the greateſt of all caſt upon the Diſſenters, as Dividers; but it is an ignorant or malicious Reproach, for there is nothing whole but the Church and Body of Chriſt: They are united to Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, by one Spirit, Faith and Love, and to one another by the ſame Bonds and Principle; Schiſm and Faction are from the Fleſh and Devil. No ſooner do
<hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethren know one another to be Brethren, but they fall upon one anothers Necks, and kiſs, and weep, and repent of all their Unkindneſſes, and expreſs the deareſt Love. <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> diſſent and part, but both agree to promote the Kingdom of Chriſt. They that are not, and will not be reconciled to God, are the great Dividers and Breakers of the Peace; they are made up of Luſts of the Fleſh, which divide and draw ſeveral ways for their Satisfaction: Whence come Wars and Fightings? come they not hence, even of your Luſts, which war in your Members? There is Diſſention in the Mind, and in the Paſſions, between the Law in the Mind and Heart, and the Luſts of the Mind and Fleſh, till the Conſcience comes to be paſt feeling, and the Sinner falls under a reprobate Mind, and then what Confuſion follows? when they call Good Evil, and Evil Good? put Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs? what open Defiance is bid to God and Chriſt! what diſſenting from, and Nonconformity to the ſacred Baptiſmal Covenant? the holy Rules of a Goſpel-Converſation? There is a Law of Faith, of Love, of Repentance, and the Penalty is heavy upon them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101841:11"/>that do not obey it; there is a Law of Righteouſneſs, of following Peace and Holineſs, without which no Man can ſee the Lord: Who tranſgreſs theſe Laws, and multitudes more? Yea, who is the Man that is guilty of all? And, what Sin ſo great now a days, and in all times, as Nonconformity? Who rob by the High-ways, who kill and ſteal, who curſe and damn? who have Wo? who have Sorrow? who have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? who have Bablings? who have Wounds without cauſe? Who have Redneſs of Eyes?
<hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> Who make the greateſt Trouble to Juſtices and Magiſtrates? <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> Who fill Priſons and breake them? Who take leave of the World at Tyburn, and other Places?
<hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> Who draw Swords, ſend Challenges, fight Duels, and murder one another firſt with Wine and Drink, and then kill their dear Companions? <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> But now, there is a Diſtinction to be made, ſome <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are tolerable, and ſome intolerable; the drunken <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> is tolerable, he hath not only taken the Oaths, but ſwears: the other is a ſober <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> and taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, will not acquit him, and he is intolerable. The
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> that aſſemble to worſhip God are intolerable; and thouſands that worſhip him not at all, are too commonly let alone. But are not Malefactors puniſhed? yes, they are, but their Crimes are againſt Civil Peace, or Righteouſneſs, and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for Irreligion. But the
<hi>Nonconformiſt Diſſenters</hi> from arbitrary and variable Impoſitions, are puniſhed heavily and ſmartly, for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſembling, and no other Cauſe, as is proved in the ſecond Plea, and is cleared hereafter.</p>
            <p>And upon this, the Kingdom is extreamly divided and troubled. There is a mighty Party in the Land, that build upon another, and a new Foundation, though by them called old. But Proteſtants agree in the ſame Foundations of Religion, obey the ſame Civil Government in the ſame Perſon, and ſame Fundamental, and Civil Laws; and yet ſome are ſeparated for Sacrifice; the Lot is caſt upon them, and great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards allowed to any that will do the Work. Our Parliaments from 1673, to the laſt, would have prevented this Ruine; but for their ſakes and their own,<note place="margin">Parliament is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Synecdochically.</note> they are now like to ſuffer. Our laſt Parliaments were choſen with leſs Expence, Debauchery, Tumult, or Faction, than any we have known in our days: Some had not been long in the Houſe, but they were driven out of their former Prejudices and Prepoſſeſſions, by the clear and convincing Reaſons and Debates of the Houſe. They were generally Men of the nobleſt Eſtates in their ſeveral Counties, but acting as if they had nothing private or domeſtick, and applying themſelves to the Preſervation of the King's Sacred Perſon,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101841:12"/>and of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, to which they are obliged by Obligations of an even laſting Effect. Since their Diſſolutions, they cannot but be ſenſible how their Proceedings are confured and expoſed, and many, either of them or of ſuch as approved of them, are put out of Commiſſion, and many that are moſt diſaffected to them are either continued, or fill up the Vacancies; and theſe proceed upon contrary Reaſons, and Motives, and run into contrary Methods: What they would have compoſed and healed, theſe do (taking the opportunity of a long Vacancy of Parliament) diſcompoſe, with a greater Severity than at any time before. And the Sufferings of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> do clear the Members of Parliament from being <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> or
<hi>Fanaticks;</hi> for if they were, they ſhould meet with the like Treatment and Uſage, and ſo the Sufferings of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ſerve as a Vindication of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from the cenſure of being ſuch themſelves. All thoſe noble and worthy Patriots are now the unſatisfied Spectators of an exceſſive Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Charge; if not irrecoverable Ruine of thouſands of peaceable Subjects, by which the King will never be enriched, nor the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The inferior Rank are affected according to their differing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Reaſon, and Senſe of Religion, and the publick Good. The more Underſtanding and diſcerning, enquire into the Cauſe of this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which is the diſſent of the <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi>'s Judgment from ſome unneceſſary and variable Impoſitions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> when ever the Government plenſeth may be taken away without derogation of Power, or loſs of any Fundamental in Religion, either of Belief or Practice, or danger to the Government or Peace: They cannot but ſay, theſe matters of Diſſention need not be. They believe their own Senſes, they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeen, nor heard of any Sedition, or Tumult, or Plot contrived among the Proteſtant Diſſenters. They know them to be Men of Abilities, Piety, Righteouſneſs and Peace, and have waded through the deep Waters of many Afflictions, without ſinking or drowning, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Ship in which too many drive a Merchandize, bring in Wealth, and others fiſh for Men, to ſave them from the bottomleſs Pit. If they are unacquainted with the Nonconformiſt Preachers, they are acquainted with their Hearers, and know their Principles, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and if they are not better, they are no worſe than other Men, and cannot but be grieved, that they lie at the Mercy of many that have no Vertue to commend them. They that love Godlineſs and Righteouſneſs in any, in whom they believe or hope it is, that are glad for the increaſe of Knowledg or Godlineſs, by what Inſtrument ſoever, and endeavour to be merciful, as their heavenly Father is merciful, are not, and cannot be pleaſed with thoſe Proceedings, of ruining Men for Conſcience: Theſe are not ſo ſubtile as to lay any great Weight upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101841:12"/>the Diſtinctions which ſome Men invent to excuſe the Severity. The more unknowing and unconcern'd are in a maze, wondring what kind of People theſe <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are; what kind of thing this Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is; but they know, or hear that the Men are given to pray, hear Sermons, ſing Pſalms, and other pious Exerciſes, and live, if not better, yet no worſe than many that go to Church: And of theſe many have ſo much Senſe, that they think and ſay ſurely, it is hard to drive honeſt Men's Cattel, ſeize their Goods, break open Houſes, for doing well. And as many as love Eaſe and the World, take their Eaſe, and follow that Religion, which is encouraged with Preferment, and a Freedom from Charge and Moleſtation.</p>
            <p>Some Zealots againſt <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are incenſed againſt them, as againſt <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that pray to devour all; as againſt ſeditious Perſons, and ſecret Traitors, that want nothing but Opportunity, as againſt the Authors of all our Unſettlements and Miſeries. Theſe are for the King, and who is againſt him? Theſe are for the Law, as now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and no alteration? which is to tie up the Power of the King, as much as the Parliament, for it is as much his Prerogative to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate old Laws when neceſſary, as to make new. Theſe are for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and againſt all that are againſt it; and what's that? for the Biſhops; and the Nonconformiſts never did as much as petition to take them down, or diminiſh their Revenues: they are for preaching in Churches, and ſo are <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> if they might; for Allegiance to the King, ſo are the <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> for the King's Supremacy, ſo are the <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> for Ceremonies and Orders of the Church: here they begin to diſagree: And for theſe things can you perſecute your Brethren? Theſe Zealots are as erroneous for theſe things, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are againſt them. The moſt of our Conforming-Proteſtant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks are bound to bear Offices, higher or lower, in Cities, Towns, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Pariſhes. The ſuperiour Magiſtrates may forbear to break open Meetings for Religious Exerciſes, or ſet others on, much more to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Rabble to pluck down their Meeting-Houſes; there is no Law for it, that we, the unskilful in the Laws, know, or hear of: The inferior are under Command, but theſe are meant of only lawful Commands, and legal Warrants. And here is now a very diſpleaſing Tragedy to be ſeen. Here are Informers, very Strangers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which they plague and moleſt, that ſwear againſt ſome Perſons by hear-ſay, whom they do not know; and theſe are the great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Juſtice, they do little leſs, nay ſometimes no leſs than expect the Juſtices ſhould take their Information without Examination of them, at their time, at the very nick, when they pleaſe, and not when the Juſtice pleaſeth: Theſe are the Maſters of the Juſtices themſelves, who muſt ſerve
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101841:13"/>them, or forfeit 50 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> to them, and 50 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> more to him that can get it. Some Juſtices are forward and officious in carrying on this <hi>Work</hi> of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Union, they iſſue forth Warrants upon them that meet, upon the Pariſh Officers that are ſlack; ſome give out Warrants to break open Houſes for diſtreſs, ſome are cautious how they go ſo far. The diſſenting Subject keeps up cloſe, and upon his Market-day keeps his Shop ſhut, as if he were broken, or hid his head from Serjeants, yea, from worſe Men than common Bailiſſs: The Informer keeps the Street, and hath whom he pleaſeth at his command. The Pariſh Officer is in a threefold Difficulty or Strait: 1. The Juſtice of Peace fines him, and threatens worſe to him, if he doth not make diſtreſs. 2. It goes againſt his Nature and his Love to his Neighbour, Friend, Kinſman; it goes againſt his Conſcience to diſtrain the Goods, and ſpoil the Trade, and beggar innocent Children, he cannot do it; but if he do not, he ſhall rue it himſelf; he is ſined, and he is further threatned. The Informer is now <hi>pro tempore,</hi> his ſuperior Officer, he muſt execute his Warrants. 3. He is in another Difficulty: If he break into his Neighbour's Houſe, he is told he cannot juſtify it by Law, by ſome ſage Counſellors; the owner of the Houſe and Goods may ſue him for breaking into his Houſe: He is told he hath but one Remedy, when he is ſued, the Juſtice will ſtand by him, and the Favour of the Court, and Partiality of a Jury, will be his Defender: But really, is not this an hard caſe, that a Man muſt ruine others, or be ruined? and do theſe Actions look as if they did really rejoyce that they are ruled by Law? when without Law, or againſt Law, he proceeds in hopes of Favour: And what is all this for, but to get Money for the chief <hi>Ruler, the noble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former!</hi> the Shame and Scourge of his Country. Gentlemen and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates that have Wiſdom to foreſee, and ſenſe of what they ſee, are diſquieted in their Minds; the Envious, in hope of encreaſing their own Trade, are more modeſt than to approve it, and they who are Scorners of Religion, make merry at it. And this is a true, but imperfect face of the times; and I divulge no Secrets.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Sufferings of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> have been courſely and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened in the two former Pleas, and will be more particularly ſet forth in what follows. Their former Sufferings come upon them again, and that with the Addition of more Weight and Violence, many have by an indecent Art done what they can, to ſhut up both his Majeſties Eyes and Heart. I call it indecent, becauſe we owe a greater Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King, they have thanked him for his ruling by Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Adherence to the Church of <hi>England</hi> as eſtabliſhed by Law: As ſoon as they have done this, they crave leave to execute the Laws
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101841:13"/>upon <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as if they would take the King at his Word, and while the Gracious Declaration was freſh, that there might be no room for wonted Mercy and Indulgence, except he ſhould recede from his Royal Word, almoſt as ſoon as ſent abroad; They ſeem to oblige the Biſhops and the Church, by declaring for it as eſtabliſh'd, and thereby tied their Tongues and Pens from ſupplicating for their Proteſtant Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; for if they do, they will be interpreted to act contrary to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own Eſtabliſhment: and no doubt but many a fair Story is told them, of I know not what inviſible Machinations againſt them: They muſt look on while a Courſe is taken, which will reflect upon them and their Government, as much, if not more, than a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nonconformity. The more diſcreet, and moderate ſort of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are look'd upon as ſavouring of Parliamentary Notions, either are left out of the Commiſſions of Lieuetenancy and Peace, or act not at all, or act by way of Mitigation of Rigor; the moſt declaredly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Parliaments, to Proteſtant Diſſenters ſeem to act alone; therefore the Law falls with multiplied Aggravations upon Preachers and People. What was argued by way of Conſequence in the ſecond Plea, proves now to be true, as if it had been a Prophecy. The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are fined for ſo many Meetings paſt: That there are Fines upon the Officers of one little Market-Town, for neglecting to break their Neighbours, amounting to 200 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> and the Fines upon one Preacher and his Hearers come to about 1000
<abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> if they may be exactly levied. What is the Caſe of Populous Places! They ſuffer ſpiritually, bodily, really, and relatively: A Man cannot marry his Daughter to a Diſſenting Proteſtant, but he is like one that throws away her Portion; a Man cannot put a Child apprentice to a Diſſenting Proteſtant, but he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſing his Money, and his Son of loſing his Trade, by his Maſter's not being able to follow it, nor to hold; many of them are in as bad a caſe as the Papiſts, if the Laws were fully executed upon them: for ſome Proteſtants are returned into the Exchequer, and their Eſtates under Compoſition, and the Parts that are left to them are liable to other Laws againſt them. But if the Executioners of the Laws ſtop at the Compoſition, there would be ſomething left certain to them: But the remaning two Parts are ſubject to theſe Laws, the
<hi>Oxford</hi> and five Mile Act, and this againſt Conventicles, and to the Eccleſiaſtical Courts beſides; they are obnoxious to Excommunications, Significavits, Writs <hi>de Excommunicatio capiendo,</hi> to Baniſhment and Abjuration, and Felony if they abjure not: Some queſtion whether that Act of Q. <hi>E.</hi> 35. be in force, but ſeveral are brought in danger of it as if it were, beſides to all manner of Taxes and Payments. They are more hardly uſed than Papiſts: Some have paid 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> and 5
<abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> over and over: But now their whole Eſtates
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101841:14"/>will not ſatisfy the Demands of Informers and Warrants. The only way that Men of Eſtates have, is to become Tenants and Servants to ſecure them, by making them over in Truſt. The Miſeries of their Souls are not yet reckoned by me, to prevent which, they have ventured long by hearing ſuch Miniſters as they conceived moſt profitable: But now for endeavouring to flee from the Wrath to come, they are fallen under the Vengeance of cruel and mercileſs Informers, and to ſave their Souls, have brought Ruine upon their Eſtates.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And what is all this for? It is for Nonconformity; which may be conſidered two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Privatively, not conforming.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Poſitively, being <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to the Laws of Uniformity, preaching, and holding Religious Exerciſes, this is the Preachers Crime; the Crime of the People is hearing, or joyning with them in ſuch Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Religion, as are without controverſy neceſſary and profitable. This, and only this, is the cauſe of all thoſe many, and great Sufferings of every kind which they have endured, and under which no man can comfortably ſtand without Faith, Self-denial, Contentment, and the Conſcience of well-doing, and the hope of Eternal Life, the great Recompence of Reward! And this being the Cauſe, and the ſole Cauſe of their Sufferings, it is ſuch as calls for Pity and great Tenderneſs, and is no juſt Cauſe of their many Moleſtations, and bitter Sufferings, as I intend to ſhew in my following Diſcourſe, as God ſhall help me.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. By whom, and from whom, and through whoſe means they are now again expoſed to Sufferings. I cannot ſhew the Spring of the Motion, but any Man may ſee the Hands that ſtrike, and tell us what time of day it is: I do very much doubt whether the moſt engaged Inſtruments do know whoſe Work they carry on, this is my Charity; but if they do, I dare ſay, what they cannot hear without either great diſpleaſure, horror or repentance. But they are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as cannot take it ill to be called Addreſſers and Abhorrers, but they (as far as I can look about me and ſee) particularly that have thanked the King for declaring his Reſolutions of ruling by Law, which if any of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> had expreſſed a doubt or fear of, had been a far greater Offence than their Nonconformity. They have declared for the Proteſtant Religion as eſtabliſhed by Law, and yet puniſh them that profeſs the ſame, and no other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And by Conſequence, they are ſuch as have declared a diſlike of the Proceedings of our late Parliaments, and in that particular of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the uniting of Proteſtant Diſſenters, in which alone I am
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101841:14"/>concerned to take notice of them, and act directly contrary to the Vote of the Houſe of Commons, which reſolved,
<hi>That it is the Opinion of this Houſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lunae 10 die Jan. 1680.</note> 
               <hi>that the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters upon the penal Laws, is at this time grievous to the Subject, a weakning to the Proteſtant Interest, an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom;</hi> And by the Rule of Oppoſition, they muſt in their Opinions turn this Vote back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as if they thought that the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the preſent Laws, is not grievous to the Subject, is not a weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Proteſtant Intereſt, is not an encouragement of Popery, nor dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom: Certainly they muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hold this, as contrary to the general and unanimous Judgment of the far greater Number: for, as <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain every particular Man's Vote; ſo it doth no leſs than imply a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or that to declare a Diſſent is to no purpoſe; there is no Diviſion of the Houſe upon it; only if they do not hold this, contrary to the Houſe, they muſt act both irrationally and deſperately in this ſenſe. Altho the Houſe of Commons declared their Opinion to be ſo; yet I a Juſtice, or I an inferiour Officer, will proſecute the Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, or execute the Penal Laws upon them, tho it be a weakening of the Proteſtant Intereſt, altho it be an Encouragement to Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom. Or if this Conſequence from theſe Proceedings be too harſh, and cenſorious, I will mollify it as much as it is capable of a mollified Conſtruction: Let this be the Opinion of the Proſecutors now. The Execution of the Penal Laws, is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to the Subject; that is, it is grievous but to ſome, and not to all: it is not grievous to the Subject, becauſe it is not grievous to them, and then we ſhall have a Diſcrimination of Subjects; to this ſenſe. They only, who execute the Laws, or approve of it, are the only Subjects of the King; or that the Diſſenters can ſuffer Puniſhments, and the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not be grievous to them. Or, that the Diſſenters are not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but Rebels (a ſort of quiet Rebels certainly) may we never ſee any other than ſuch unarmed quiet Rebels! Again, they muſt think, that the Execution of the Laws upon them, is no weakning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt; that is to ſay, they are no Proteſtants. And now the meaning is plain, that there are no Proteſtants amongſt us, but thoſe that are of the Church-Government eſtabliſhed by Law, and are of it, or ſubmit to it; or that read, or joyn in the Liturgy, or do all that the Law requires; that is, the Act of Uniformity, and then a Queſtion will ariſe, Where was the Proteſtant Religion before 1662, or before the laſt Long-Parliament? Or, where is it like to be, when theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants no-Proteſtant-Diſſenters are cut off? where it was before
<hi>Luther.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101841:15"/>If only the Conformiſts are the Proteſtants, then what ſort of them? If only one ſort of them, then the Catholick Church of <hi>England</hi> may be not much bigger than ſome great Conventicle, or great Pariſh. They who make this Separation of Proteſtants, are Separatiſts and Diſciples, the National Tutors and Inſtructors, in ſuch wholſome and profitable Doctrine, both in Divinity, and Politicks. If Confirmity, <hi>tota in toto,</hi> &amp;c. makes the Proteſtant, and be convertible with him, it makes as good a Definition of a Proteſtant, as of a Man by Accidents. A Man is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature, that wears curled Locks, long Hair, Hoſe and Shoos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of a Philoſopher, he is a Scholar that wears a Beard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to go on, they may be thought to be of Opinion, that to puniſh Diſſenters, is no Encouragement to Popery; for when they have rooted them up, then they will root up Popery, as if they could not come at thoſe great Oaks, before they have cut up the Bruſh-wood. Or laſtly, they do not think it dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom, to ſuppreſs Diſſenters. 1. Becauſe they know that the Diſſenters, when undone, will not moleſt or diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom. Or elſe, 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they intend to make them ſo poor, that they ſhall not be able to diſturb the Peace. Or, 3. Becauſe it is the only way of Peace.</p>
            <p>But here again, a Queſtioniſt ſets upon me as I go peaceably on in my Diſcourſe. If the Diſſenters are not dangerous to the Peace of Kingdom, why are they diſturb'd, and their Meetings broken up as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Meetings?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they are dangerous, and their Meetings feditious, then whether are they more dangerous, when they are pleaſed, quiet, and in Peace, or when they are provoked? When they enjoy Trades, Liberty, and Eſtates, or when they are impriſoned and undone?</p>
            <p>To conclude this Head: If our zealous Proſecutors think, as the Houſe of Commons did, in their foreſaid Vote; then why will they act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that general Opinion? or if they are of a contrary Opinion, as I have ſaid: then follows,</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third Branch of the Deſcription of the Proſecutors. They are ſuch as do not, yea cannot underſtand the State of the Kingdom, and Religion ſo well as the Houſe of Commons did.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No one Man of them can underſtand the true State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as a Grand Aſſembly of our Repreſentatives did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor all of them: for when the Repreſentatives of the Kingdom met, they had ſuch Informations given in, and brought before them, and ſaw what was inviſible to others; there was a Collection of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and the Eyes of moſt of the Kingdom moved in that great Body, and their Debates and Reaſonings were mature, and full. And tho a Vote have not the Formality and Force of an Act, yet it is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101841:15"/>the firſt Matter and Original of an Act, out of which an Act doth ariſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Vote was not of private Concernment, in which, Intereſt makes Men partial, but it was of Concernment to the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But many of the firſt movers in the Proſecution, and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in it, act from a private Spirit, and a particular Intereſt, and find neither Concurrence from any, that are at liberty, and act as Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor Approbation from the Standers-by; except the few that know not what they do, and care not what others do, any more than <hi>Gallio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the inferiour ſort, are Informers and Inferiour Officers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, and Church-wardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of theſe, there is not one of many, but what abide ſevere Threatnings, and heavy Fines, conſidering their Eſtates, before they diſtrain. This way is contrary to the very common Senſe of Chriſtians, and ordinary Men. But the Informers are a ſelect Company, whom the long Suffering of God permits for a time, of whom I will ſay but little in this place: They are of no good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for their Knowledg in the Country, they do not know the Names, or Perſons of ſome of them that are moleſted by them; they go by report of their under-Servants or Complices; they are unknown to them that ſuffer by them, until they ſuffer: They come two or three Counties off, to ſet up this new Trade; whether they are Papiſts or (nominal) Proteſtants, who can tell? They never come to Church, not to their own Pariſh-Churches, but lie in wait and ambuſh. Their Eſtate is inviſible, their Country unknown to many; their Morals are as bad as the very Dregs of the Age. Theſe are they that direct and rule many of the Magiſtrates, and live upon the ſpoil of better Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Subjects than themſelves; And who go away with honeſt Mens Goods, honeſtly gotten, but they? To whom I have a great deal to ſay in the latter Part, if I can hold my Pen without trembling, while I write of them.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of what I intend to diſcourſe upon, is contained in theſe three Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. I will ſhew the Cauſe of the Sufferings of the
<hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. Argue for a Ceſſation of this forcible Courſe againſt them.</item>
               <item>III. Apply the whole to the Inſtruments of their Sufferings, whether they be Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Informers, or others.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. The only Cauſe of their Sufferings, is their Nonconformity. Of this I have ſpoken as fully as I thought needful at that time, both in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101841:16"/>the <hi>Firſt Plea;</hi> opening the hardneſs of their Caſe, in the <hi>Second Plea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Firſt Plea, from <hi>p. 14, &amp;c.</hi> Second Plea, <hi>p. 10,
11.</hi>
               </note> I muſt reaſſume this Head anew, for a further Information of the World, and Amplification of the thing, in reference to their Suflerings; and lay both before the Conſcience of the Chriſtian Reader, who <hi>may propoſe this Caſe of Conſcience, as riſing from it, Whether the Nonconforming Chriſtians and Proteſtants ought to ſuffer as they do, and what they do, meerly for Nonconformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the opening of this Point once again, I will conſider Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity as above-ſaid.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Privatively, and paſſively, as not doing what the Law requires.</item>
               <item>2. Poſitively and actively, as doing what the Law forbids.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Take Nonconformity in the firſt Senſe, and what is it but not ſubſcribing, or refuting to ſubſcribe to what is required, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what is required to be declared in the Act of Uniformity? and by conſequence, not doing as is required in the Act, or the Common-Prayer; here lies their Nonconformity; and hence the Name is taken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They do not refuſe all and every Condition therein required of them. It is not poſſible that I ſhould particularly relate what Particular-Men do ſcruple, and ſtick at; ſome can do more than others can; but they who can do moſt, cannot do all required.</p>
            <p>They are by ſome counted worſe than Papiſts; looked upon as a fort of ignorant, erroneous, obſtinate, unreaſonable Men, ſeditious, and ſchiſmatical, that obey neither King, nor Biſhops, nor Church; and are ignorantly, and ſcornfully called <hi>Theſe Men,</hi> and <hi>theſe kind of People,</hi> as if they were a ſtrange odd ſort of People, wilfully bent upon their own Way, Deluſions, and Fancies, as if they carried the Sparks of Rebellion, and the Seeds of Hereſies, and falſe Doctrine in their Hearts, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in their Conventicles.</p>
            <p>But know that they are as obedient, regular Subjects as any in the King's Dominions, ſave in one Defect, or Omiſſion, which is Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, Swearing, Declaring according to a particular late Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and Corporation. And to them that wonder at them, that cenſure, condemn, and afflict them, I give this ſhort Diſtinction, and Account of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Preachers and Teachers, are Men brought up in Learning, in Schools and Univerſities, or in Univerſity Learning, if not in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities. The older ſort have for the moſt part, taken Degrees in the Univerſities, were in former times ordained by Biſhops, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101841:16"/>to all, or the principal things required by the old Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The middle-aged among them have had the like Learned Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and are Miniſters, either ordained by Biſhops, or by Presbyters, or elected and choſen by particular Congregations, and ſet apart for that Work by Faſting and Prayer, if not alſo, by Impoſition of Hands. The younger ſort, have Education in Learning, in Schools, Tongues, Arts and Sciences, the ſame that are taught in our Univerſities, though they are taught out of the Univerſities, in a more private way, and have not the Titles of Graduates in Arts and Divinity. In a word, they are (tho in different Degrees and Proportion, ſome more, and ſome leſs) learned, pious, painful, ſelf-denying, able, and ſucceſsful Miniſters, and orderly, and peaceable Subjects according to all other Laws, as any of us are: Their Hearers are like other Men, bred up in Trades, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as other Men are, as is commonly and univerſally known.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, let them that think ſtrangely of them, as
<hi>theſe Men, and theſe kind of Men,</hi> receive this impartial Character of them:<note place="margin">☜</note> The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are Chriſtians, believing all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whatſoever Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles to obſerve, and teach; that obſerve all the Ordinances of the Goſpel, according to the general Rules of the Goſpel-Worſhip, Government and Diſcipline (according to the beſt of their Underſtandings, and Prudence); that obey every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man for the Lord's ſake; that are ſubject to Principalities and Powers; that obey Magiſtrates, that live by the Law of Love, and Rightcouſneſs; that have their Converſation according to the Goſpel, as other Chriſtians, or as the beſt of other Chriſtians do, and that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, obſerve, and obey all Laws of the Kingdom, as other Subjects do; ſave the aforeſaid Act of Uniformity, and Subſcriptions and Oaths of late Years impoſed, and never before.</p>
            <p>And this Character of them, contains matter of Anſwer to the many Queſtions, Accuſations and Cenſures raiſed upon them.

            <p>In the <hi>Second Plea,</hi> p. 10, 11, 12. I have ſaid, that the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> (commonly, but unduly and unſitly called <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) and the <hi>Conformiſt,</hi> is to be ſeen and gathered from the King's own Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which they would have ſubmitted to, if it had been turned into an Act of Parliament, and the Act of Uniformity.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101841:17"/>
            <p>I ſhall now further enlarge upon that Notion, and ſhew you what the King declared, and what they would have accepted; becauſe many that think and ſpeak hardly of them, do not know how things ſtood at that time, and what that Declaration is.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1660, after that General <hi>Monk,</hi> (made Duke of
<hi>Albemarle</hi> afterwards by the King) declared himſelf for a Free-Parliament, and by the Counſel and Aſſiſtance of the City of
<hi>London,</hi> reſtored the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the old Parliament, that were ſhut out by ſome of the Army, before ever they could bring about their Deſigns againſt the King's Life; and there was a wiſe and good Council of State choſen: many of the Royal Nobility, and Gentry, and ſome Divines, put out a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which are theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And we do further declare, that we intend by our quiet and peaceable Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to teſtify our Submiſſion to the preſent Power, as it now reſides in the Council of State, in Expectation of the future Parliament, upon whoſe Wiſdom and Determinations, we truſt God will give ſuch a Bleſſing as may produce a perfect Settlement both in Church and State.</hi> This was ſubſcribed by the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and twenty Earls and Lords, ſeveral Noble-Men, about thirty two Baronets and Knights, and between eighty and an hundred Gentlemen, among whom is Mr.
<hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> (then a Chriſtian, profeſſing Reconciliation, promiſing with the reſt, <hi>To ſpeak one Language, to be of one Name</hi> (not <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory</hi>) <hi>that all mention of Factions and Parties, and all Rancor may be thrown in and buried like Rubbiſh under the Foundation:</hi> Theſe are the words of it; but as Dr.

            <p>The Parliament which reſtored the King, then ſitting, thanked him for this Declaration; the Divines of <hi>London,</hi> called the
<hi>Presbyterian,</hi> did alſo thank him for it: and I never was acquainted with any conforming Divine, that did not approve of it, more than of the exact Conformity afterwards required; and I cannot but think, if a Scrutiny were to be made, but more Miniſters of Learning, Plety and Experience, that are not biaſſed with Preferments, would judg it a far better Expedient for our Peace, and the Propagation of the Proteſtant Religion (as his Majeſty ſpeaks) than our tried Strictreſs and Rigor; yea, I doubt not but many of our conſiderable dignified Clergy, are, or would be, of the ſame mind.</p>
            <p>After this, the King gave a Commiſſion according to his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to an equal number of Divines, to review, and reform the Common-Prayer. The Presbyterian Divines (as they were called) preſented their Exceptions to the Biſhops and Commiſſioners, who returned them an Anſwer, not favouring of fatherly Condeſcention, nor giving hopes of a deſirable Cloſure, not as much as to leave the uſe of a Ceremony at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and free; and by the ſtile it ſeems to be written by one or more of the Doctors, and not by the Biſhops themſelves. To this the other Commiſſioners replied, which was not thought worth their notice, ſo much as to give them another gentle Rebuke.</p>
            <p>When the four Months, allowed for the Debates and Confultation, were expired, the Commiſſioners, who were ſlighted, preſent a Petition and due Account of the matter to the King, and ſay thus.

            <p>They preſented to the Biſhops and the other Commiſſioners the Reformation of the Liturgy, and a moſt humble, grave, pathetical Petition, called the Petition for Peace; towards the end, the addreſs themſelves to them in theſe Words, <hi>Grant us but the Freedom which Chriſt and his Apoſtles loſt unto the Churches; uſe neceſſary things as neceſſary, and unneceſſary things as unneceſſary; and charitably bear with the Infirmities of the weak, and tolerate the tolerable while they live peaceably, and then you will know when you have done; and for the Intolerable, we beg not your Toleration,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible I have been long upon this hiſtorical Retroſpect of theſe Paſſages, to inform thoſe who ſeem not to know, or remember theſe things; Yet I cannot go on without leaving ſome Animadverſions and Remarks upon them.</p>

And the King to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect all, by laying a Top-ſtone, as well as the Foundation of the Temple of Peace, gathers all Parties into himſelf; ſome by Comprehenſion in a wider Conſtitution, others by a ſafe indulgent Toleration, which if granted, had been deſired by the leaſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable part of the Nation; for the Diſſenters had been fewer than now they are, becauſe abundance had been taken into the propoſed Settlement: The Sects have much encreaſed, ſince that time of Papiſts, if not other Denominations —.

            <p n="2">2.

It is a moſt afflicting Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that Church-Diviſions are moſt difficultly healed. What an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Thought is this! that a temporal Intereſt divides wordly Men, in whom Self prevails, and yet worldly Men can unite under general Common Laws, becauſe it is their Intereſt to unite; and yet they, who of all Men are under the greateſt Obligations to unite, that declare they are not of this World, that teach the way of Peace to others, cannot find it themſelves! But it is not Religion, and Light, that divide, but it is Darkneſs, and the Spirit of this World. If to us to live were Chriſt, then Chriſtian Faith and Love, would make us more heavenly, and by Conſequence, more united. Popery could never have that Compaſs to work our Ruine in, had we agreed as we ſhould have done: Pardon this Excurſion; I'll return.

<hi>Priſons,</hi> and with that dreadful Sentence of Abjuration. And Chriſtian Reader, if you do as I do, here Grief doth make you ſtop. That any Magiſtrate that hath taken the Sacrament to prove himſelf a Proteſtant, dare menace, or admoniſh any Chriſtian Miniſter to do what he cannot do, or forſwear his native Country!

<hi>England</hi> would juſtly be offended, ſince ſuch an Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be a virtual Conceſſion, that this Liturgy was an intolerable Burthen to tender Conſciences, a direct Cauſe of Schiſm, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Uſage (upon which Pretences it is here deſired to be altered) which would at once juſtify all thoſe who have obſtinately ſeparated from it, as the only pious, tender-conſcienced Men, and condemn all thoſe that have adhered to it, in conſcience of their Duty and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, with the loſs and hazards of their Eſtates, and Fortunes, as Men ſuperſtitious, ſchiſmatical, and void of Religion and Conſcience. For theſe Reaſons and thoſe that follow, we cannot conſent to ſuch an Alteration as is deſired, till theſe Pretences be proved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now it might eaſily appear to them, what afterwards came to paſs; but let us obſerve:</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101841:21"/>
            <p n="1">1. There is no doubt but ſome of them knew what his Majeſties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was, for the Propagation of the Proteſtant Religion; being his Chaplains and chief Miniſters about him, and ſome of them (if I am not miſ-informed) made ſome Alterations and Amendments in the King's Declaration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They do manifeſt an Opinion of the Reforming Divines, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Character which his Majeſty gave of them, <hi>as grave and learned Miniſters;</hi> and proceed with them according to a mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Opinion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If they ſaw no neceſſity of any Alterations: 1. They diſſented from the Judgment of as eminent Divines of the Church,<note place="margin">See Firſt Plea, <hi>p. 22, &amp;c. p. 32.</hi>
               </note> as any in it. 2. They do not agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; for Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> one of them, thought a Reformation was neceſſary to Union. 3. They made ſome Alterations, ſuch as were pleaſing to them, though not ſatisfactory to others. 4. They deſtroy the King's Suppoſition, and the reaſon of his Propoſal, for the Propagation of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Peace of the Church, ſatisfying tender Conſciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If they were <hi>commiſſioned to adviſe,</hi> &amp;c. then had it not been a great Satisfaction to the whole Church, and an effectual way to ſilence the cavilling Opponents (if they were but Cavillers)? 1. To have anſwered their Reply. 2. to have petitioned his Majeſty for a longer time, to have heard them out, but when eight Points were to be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they had only time for one of them, being the laſt day of their Commiſſion.<note place="margin">If I am miſtaken in any of theſe things, as I believe I am not, I ſhall be glad to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a trie Hiſtory of thoſe Paſſages.</note> It was about <hi>giving the Sacrament to Perſons that ſcruple kneeling;</hi> about which there was a Diviſion among <hi>themſelves:</hi> Some of them held that we are not to refuſe to give it to them that kneel not, but to give it to them that kneel: the words of the Rubrick being, — <hi>The Miniſter ſhall take in both kinds himſelf, — and deliver it into the hands of the People kneeling;</hi> as if the ſenſe were, we are to give the Sacrament into the hands of the People kneeling; but are not forbid to give it to them that do not kneel: Dr.
<hi>G.</hi> Dr. <hi>P.</hi> and Dr.<hi>S.</hi> were for this lax Interpretation;<note place="margin">Now Lord Biſhops of <hi>Ely, Cheſter, Norwich.</hi>
               </note> other Dr. <hi>M.</hi> now Biſhop of
<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was for the rigid ſenſe, that the People muſt kneel, or we muſt not give it. And Dr. <hi>P.</hi> now Dean of

<hi>38.</hi>
               </note> that it was an Act of Mercy to thoſe that ſcruple and refuſed to receive the Sacrament kneeling, to deny them the Communion of the Church therein; but the Commiſſioners of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101841:21"/>his own ſide reſtrained him. 4. How little did ſome of them care for the King's conjuring them, to acquieſce in, and ſubmit to his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or, tho his Majeſty thought himſelf competent to propoſe (a Remedy) they thought him not, or elſe they would have adviſed a little further, having ſo great a charge from him, giving him hopes of their Compliance, and ſeeing the Peace and Settlement of the Church ſo much concerned in it, and the Houſe of Commons approving of it, to whom they owned an Acknowledgment for their Service done for them, they might have made their Memorial bleſſed to all Generations, as Healers and Peace-makers.</p>
            <p>And now it is plain that thoſe who ruled moſt in thoſe Councils, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed a kind of Soveraignty over the Reaſon of all others, and waited for a Parliament and Convocation that ſhould at once ſilence Objections, and anſwer Petitions.</p>
            <p>Since thoſe Tranſactions, the reforming Divines never had but one: or two Opportunities of treating and compoſing our doleful Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Compoſers agreed; but the Houſe of Commons hearing of it, voted againſt bringing in a Bill of Compreehenſion, and the Reverend Dr.
<hi>Burnet,</hi> in the Life of the Great Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> gives us the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that prevailed at that time againſt it. And if I may not be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, I will crave leave totranſcribe his Lines.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But two Parties appeared vigorouſly againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (of Comprehenſion by Law) the one was of ſome zealous Clergy-Men, who thought it below the Dignity of the Church to alter Laws, and change Settlements for the ſake of ſome, whom they eſteemed Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks; they alſo believed it was better to keep them out of the Church, than bring them into it, ſince a Faction upon that would ariſe in the Church, which they thought might be more dangerous than the Schiſm it ſelf was. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they ſaid, if ſome things were now to be changed in compliance with the Humor of a Party, as ſoon as that was done, another Party might demand other Conceſſions, and there might be as good Reaſons invented for theſe as for thoſe; many ſuch Conceſſions might alſo ſhake thoſe of our own Communion, and tempt them to for ſake us, and go over to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>pretending that we changed ſo often, that they were thereby inclined to be of a Church that was conſtant and true to her ſelf; and theſe Reaſons wrought on the far greater part of the Houſe of Commons —. There were others that oppoſed it upon very different Ends: They deſigned to ſhelter the Papiſts from the Execution of the Law, and ſaw clearly that nothing would bring in Popery ſo well as a Toleration; but to tolerate Popery bare-faced, would have ſtartled the Nation too much, ſo it was neceſſary to hinder all the Propoſitions for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, ſeeing the keeping up the Differences was the beſt colour they could find, for getting the Toleration to paſs, only as ſtackening the Laws againſt Diſſenters, whoſe Numbers and Wealth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101841:22"/>made it adviſeable to have ſome regard to them; and under this pretence Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might have crept in more covered, and leſs regarded: ſo theſe Councils being more acceptable to ſome concealed Papiſts then in Power, as has ſince appeared too evidently, the whole Project for Comprehenſion was let fall, and thoſe who had ſet it afoot, came to be looked on with an evil Eye, as ſecret Favourers of Diſſenters, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderminers of the Church, and every thing elſe that Jealouſy and Diſtaſte could caſt on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not queſtion but this excellent Hiſtorian hath given us a faithful account of the Reaſons againſt Comprehenſion, as he received them from thoſe eminent Perſons engaged in it, or ſome that knew them; and I will make bold to caſt ſome Reflections upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On the one part ſome zealous Church-men, who thought it below the Dignity of the Church to alter Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when it is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their Spirit and Ends, it is no Indignity to change mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Laws into more ſevere; nor, to practiſe arbitrarily beyond Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They who rationally and conſcienciouſly diſſent, are eſteemed Schiſmaticks: but retaining all other their Opinions and Principles, and abating the rigor of their Diſſent, by conforming, would they be of the Church, or ſtill eſteemed Sciſmaticks? By this Notion, the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>qua talis,</hi> is no Schiſmatick; and the Nonconformiſt, <hi>quatenus</hi> ſuch, is a Schiſmatick. Conformity takes away all name of Schiſm: But then the Queſtion might be, Whether the
<hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> be a State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchiſmatick, or a Church-ſchiſmatick? and, whether he was a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, when he treated about, and petitioned for Peace and Union? and what hath made him to be one ſince?</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are afraid of Faction: but do thoſe Fears ariſe from a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or a Factious Spirit? Are there not factious Spirits in the Church, that harbour factious Affections, and utter factious Words, contrary to true Charity?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And what if other Parties might demand Conceſſions? Either thoſe Conceſſions were rational, becoming the Wiſdom, Peaceableneſs, and Grace of the Church, or not; methinks it's a Royal Dignity in the Church, to make reaſonable Conceſſions: if they are unreaſonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, impious and the like, the Church may deny them with Honour. But theſe Sons and Fathers, repreſent the Church like a ſtately Lady that keeps Chamber, and muſt not be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But really, are there ſuch among us, as taking Offence, might go over to the Church of <hi>Rome, conſtant and true to her ſelf?</hi> How much do they owe to the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> for their Company and Communion! How inclinable are they to <hi>Rome,</hi> that are ready to depart upon ſmall Conceſſions! The Conſtancy of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> is as inſeparable a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101841:22"/>Property of hers, as her Infallibility. Methinks this is much to the Diſhonour of many of our Church, and much to the Honour of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> that whatever they ſuffer, there is no danger that they will turn Papiſts: But weak Reaſons have great force in them, when they that are narrow in their Charity, and powerful in Place, have the Management of them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The World is too apt to be jealous; but have not the
<hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> ſome Reaſon to be jealous of this ſort of zealous Clergy-men, that there is ſome Agreement, or Bargain between them and the Friends and Kinſmen of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> that both ſhall agree to keep the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> out? And is not the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> better conditioned, and better natured than theſe zealous Clergy-men? for there is not a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> but may be entertained among them, without fear of encreaſing a Faction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is not a very doubtful thing, whether our zealous Clergy-men are the beſt or the worſt ſort of our Clergy, that argue ſo ſtiſly againſt a legal Comprehenſion of the Orthodox
<hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> with Reaſons of ſo little weight, or that are ſo little ſenſible of the Uſefulneſs, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs of the Abilities of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> to the great and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing need of Souls.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This is a Vindication of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> from bringing in of Popery; for the way of getting into the Papiſts hath been the ſhutting out of them; they hope to get by a Toleration. There would be no colourable Reaſons for a Toleration, if it were not a pretended Favour to the
<hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> Take away Nonconformity as much as you can, and you take away the faireſt pretence for a Toleration. They that appear againſt the uniting of Proteſtants upon Catholick Terms, ſerve the Popiſh Turn and Intereſt, and are effectually ill Friends to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt, and by Conſequence our excluding Impoſitions do more real Hurt than Good, to the Proteſtant Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The diſſenting Proteſtants may know who are their Friends, and who their Enemies, and what Potent Enemies they have, they have the Zealous Clergy againſt them, and the Politick Potent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We ſee the little Confidence or Aſſurance we have of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of many that are in the Communion of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> for if the receiving of the Proteſtant Diſſenters upon Catholick Terms, be hazardous of loſing, or of the revolt of them to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the more conſtant and true to her ſelf, then what will become of them, if Popery ſhould ſo far obtain, as to be able to give them Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Favour? for if they are ſo inclinable to revolt for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions of the Church, in ſome things extra-eſſential to the Church,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101841:23"/>upon ſhew of Inconſtancy, what would they be, when our Church is like to be loſt, or ſuppreſt?</p>
            <p n="11">11. Whether there is not a latent untruſty Party of ſchiſmatical Formaliſts in the Church, that are Schiſmaticks
<hi>depoſitivè?</hi> for it ſeems they cannot bear the Reconciliation, and Reſtitution of the ejected; and if they are upon that in danger of apoſtatizing to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are they not in danger of becoming the rankeſt Schiſmaticks in the World, by returning Members of an apoſtate, ſchiſmatical Church, the Mother of Schiſms?</p>
            <p n="12">12. By this, among other Reaſons, I am convinced that it is the Duty of all ſound and ſincere Proteſtants of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> to pray for and by all peaceable ways to endeavour the re-admiſſion of all ſound Proteſtant Diſſenters, and a Catholick Union of us all. And I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the <hi>learned Biſhop Coſins</hi> ſaw the State of Religion, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his laſt Teſtament, that it was the great Duty of us all to unite. And how much we are bound to acknowledg, and with all due Honour to remember the Loyal and Chriſtian Endeavours of our late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to unite us. I did at firſt deſign to compare the foreſaid Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to which, if turned into an Act, the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> would have conformed; and the Act of Uniformity to which they cannot conform, for a further Illuſtration of the deſpiſed Caſe of the <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> but I hope there is enough ſpoken to inform the leſs knowing, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the more knowing, in their charitable Opinion of them. I have traced the divided Rivers to the Head of them; and for that reaſon, that Truth may appear. From all this you may ſee a Concord between the King propoſing, and the Houſe of Commons, by their Thanks, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of it; and the major part of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ready to ſubmit to it. On the other ſide, you ſee the Biſhops and Doctors diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the King and Commons (that reſtored them) and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Divines, and not ſo concordant in their Sentiments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as to denominate them unanimous, and could they have exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Charity but wide enough, they had provided well for a more durable Peace, defended with Conſiderations, againſt which, but few would have drawn out the ſmall Powers of their Miſ-underſtandings, to give trouble to it. There was not an exact Uniformity in their Notions; ſome thought a Reformation neceſſary to the Church's Settlement: Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> wrote for it; and when the Commiſſioners on both ſides, began to diſpute, it was ſeaſonably cloſed up; leſt the Diſogree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the anti-reforming-ſide had more appeared, ſome of whom undertook the Conduct of others, under whom a Promoter of their Deſign, the Lord Chancellor
<hi>Hide,</hi> appeared and acted, (who in the Year 1641, was Chair-man of the Committee againſt the Biſhops;)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101841:23"/>others gave Reputation, but little Addition of Help; others were varl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſtrumental, ſome by their Learning, others with their eagerneſs, and others with their keen and inverate Antipathy againſt ſome, if not all of the reforming ſide, and differed in as many Points from the Doctrine of the Church, as the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> differed from the Diſcipline and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church, and were doctrinal <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> And it is clear, that they did not humbly and brotherly adviſe, nor maturely debate the matters committed to them, and not doubting of an hopeful manageable Number of the ſucceeding Parliament, their Reſolutions paſſed into an Act, they took no more notice of the King's Declaration, than to make an hiſtorical mention of it, that ſuch a thing had been, but enact nothing commended by it, in mittigation or favour to the Diſſenting-ſide, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more Conditions, and adding heavy Penalties, which that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the latter times of it would have abated; but it was too late, as was ſaid elſe-where. This is the Act to which the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> cannot conform; and they have given ſuch Reaſons, and ſo many, for this paſſive Nonconformity, that as many good Men as I know, are ſorry they have ſo much to ſay, and their diſguſted Adverſaries are diſpleaſed and incenſed with them, and no Man is thought yet to give a full and ſufficient Anſwer to them, being rather ſlighted than anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; or what the one takes in a ſtrict and honeſt ſenſe, the other is fain to expound in a very general, and well-meaning ſenſe; according to one, more may conform than yet have conformed, according to the other, there are but few, if any, that have conformed, in my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This being in part ſpoken to in the <hi>Firſt Plea,</hi> I cannot ſtay any longer upon this Head, but paſs to the other Conſideration of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nonconformity taken <hi>actively and poſitively;</hi> and that is preaching and performing other Religious Exerciſes, as it is commonly ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, by forbidden Men, and in a diſallowed way. And for this ſeveral Nonconformiſt Miniſters are at this time hunted, moleſted, and admoniſhed, according to the ſtricteſt Form of Law, in order to Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Abjuration, or to be proſecuted as Felons, in caſe of their Obſtinacy and Refuſal: Some of them have apologized for their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a manner, that if they are not anſwered in a rational, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able convincing way, they will not be uſed as rational Men, and their Sufferings will be the more harſh, but not more hard to be born by them, becauſe they have given Reaſons for their Actions, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them either unanſwerable, and that will make their Sufferings more comfortable; or elſe their Oppreſſors are the more implacable, and then they muſt the more meekly acquieſce in the divine Pleaſure, as called forth to ſuffer. The Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath written an Apology
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101841:24"/>for the Nonconformiſt Miniſtry, dedicated to ſix of the Right Reverend Biſhops, by Name, and a Petition, which deſerves the ſerious peruſal of their Lordſhips, and all other Miniſters, Magiſtrates, and Gentlemen, that they may either ſatisfy them, or be ſatisfied by them. The Caſe is momentous, becauſe the Salvation of Souls, the many perſonal and real Sufferings of Men in Bodies and Eſtates, the healing of Diviſions, and ſettling of the Church, are unconceiveably touched, and concerned in it: Mr. <hi>John Troughton</hi> hath written a Book with the ſame Title, upon the ſame Argument. And altho the Right Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> hath done well in dealing faithfully with Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> he did ill in not dealing fairly with that Book, and worſe in expoſing him as uncapable, unfit to propoſe Terms of Peace; by which I think that Excellent Biſhop hath not ſeen his <hi>Terms of Concord, 2d</hi> part.</p>
            <p>And this being ſtated, let us modeſtly conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether this their poſitive Nonconformity be not capable of an Apology?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it be not an hard caſe to ſilence, ſuppreſs, and puniſh them for endeavouring the Good of precious Souls?</p>
            <p>For the firſt;</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Chriſtian ſhould doubt that the Office of the Miniſtry is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from Jeſus Chriſt, and not of Men. The extraordinary and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Office of the Miniſtry of the Word and Sacraments are derived from the ſame Divine Supream Authority. He that made the Apoſtles able Miniſters of the New-Teſtament, hath made, and makes all other lawful,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6.</note> ſitted, and faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Miniſters of the New-Teſtament; it is their Gift, and their Learning, their Office and Work, to declare and publiſh that New-Teſtament, or Covenant of Grace, the Commands, Conditions Priviledges, and Promiſes of it, to call and invite Sinners to it, to accept of the Grace therein revealed, to ſubmit to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of it, perform the Conditions and Duties required, to make them thereby capable of the Priviledges and Promiſes annexed to it, and to train up, edify, build, comfort, and perfect all that are in it. This is an Office neceſſary, uſeful and proper to his Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They who are called and ſent by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Qui fecit not done<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os Miniſtros <hi>N.T</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo fecit? per Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſuum tanquam per Principium effectivum; per Gratium Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

29.</note> and according to his Mind, are qualified, prepared and inſtructed for their Work and Office, by the Holy Ghoſt, who was promiſed and ſent by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Being in ſome lower meaſure at firſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fitted for their Work; the Holy Ghoſt is the prime, and effectual
<hi>Mover</hi> of them to exerciſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101841:24"/>thoſe Gifts which they have received in the Service of their Maſter in Heaven, Jeſus Chriſt. And this that great and ſolemn Interrogatory, which requires a ſincere, ſenſible, ſolemn, and ſerious Anſwer, our Ordination doth put out of doubt. Do you truſt that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">The ordering of Deacons.</note> to take upon you this Office, <hi>&amp;c? Anſw.</hi> I truſt ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Being prepared and moved by the Holy Ghoſt, they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto, and are called by ſome in a Church (where a Church is conſtituted) to exerciſe thoſe Abilities, received from Chriſt by the Holy Spirit, for the Ends of the Goſpel, the Salvation of immortal Souls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All that the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church are required to do, or can do as Ordainers, is, to try their Fitneſs and Diſpoſition, and finding them fit, to approve and ſeparate them to the Office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to declare them to have Authority, to exhort them to Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Faithfulneſs in their Office, and to teſtify this to the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. No Biſhop or Paſtors can juſtly refuſe, and juſtify the refuſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt, to whom they muſt give an account, of any Perſon duly qualified with neceſſary Qualifications for the Miniſtry; for it is a Sin to refuſe him, whom Chriſt hath by his Spirit fitted for, and excited to his Work by his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As long as their Gifts and Abilities are continued, and the Holy Ghoſt doth continue his gracious Motions and Aſſiſtances, ſo long theſe Miniſters muſt continue in the Exerciſe, and diſcharge of their Office; for there is the ſame Reaſon to continue them, as there was to admit them, they continuing the ſame.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Their fitneſs for the Work of the Miniſtry conſiſting in ſoundneſs of Knowledg and Faith, aptneſs to teach, gift of Utterance, declared Reſolutions, and undertaking to teach and do what Chriſt hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with Perſeverance therein, as a Guide and Example to the Flock, are ſufficient Conditions of admittance into the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. To do all things decently and in order, and to Edification, are neceſſary by the Law of Chriſt's Kingdom, and not indifferent. It may well be queſtioned, whether any Man otherwiſe fitted for the Miniſtry, ſhould be refuſed, becauſe he refuſeth to ſubſcribe, vow, promiſe, declare, to any doubtful, controverted Conditions of Admiſſion or Continuance; which are commonly invented by controverſial, contentious, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Men, who do not only propoſe their Conceptions to others, but make them a Standard and Meaſure to regulate other Mens Minds, and Practices; and not only ſo, but think it meet, that all ſhall be puniſhed that diſagree, and diſſent from them.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:101841:25"/>
            <p>For the Confirmation of theſe things, with the Authority of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Let us obſerve the Form of ordering Prieſts and Deacons: The <hi>Preface</hi> ſaith,
<q rend="margQuotes">The Biſhop knowing either by himſelf, or by ſufficient Teſtimony any Perſon to be of vertuous Converſation, and without Crime, and after Examination and Trial, finding him learned in the Latine Tongue, and ſufficiently inſtructed in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may — admit him Deacon —. The Biſhop ſaith to the Arch-Deacon, Take heed that the Perſons, whom you preſent unto us, be apt and meet for their Learning, and Godly Converſation —. The Biſhop examines them in the preſence of all the People — Do you truſt you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon you this Office —? Do you think you are truly called according to the Will of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt —? Do you unfeignedly believe all the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture of the Old and New Teſtament? Then opening his Office, he asks him, Will you do this gladly and willingly? Will you apply your Diligence to frame and faſhion your own Lives, and of your Families, according to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and be Examples of the Flock of Chriſt—?</q> The other Queſtion relates to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Church, as Obedience to the Ordinary, and his godly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, which is a local Condition, in order to their Admiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Church-form of Government, which is diſputed by ſome of the Parties when any is preſented to the Prieſt-hood: The Biſhop cautions the Arch-Deacon;
<q rend="margQuotes">Take heed that the Perſons whom you preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, be apt and meet, for their Learning and godly Converſation, to exerciſe their Miniſtry duly, to the honour of God, and the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Church —. I think them ſo to be: Then ſhall the Biſhop ſay unto the People, Good People, theſe are they whom we purpoſe, God willing, to receive this day unto the Holy Office of Prieſt-hood; for after due Examination we find not to the contrary, but that they be lawfully called to their Function and Miniſtry, and that they be Perſons meet for the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Note from this, that Learning and Godly Converſation are the conſtituting Qualifications of a Man lawfully called to the Function of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>In the Collect afterwards, they pray God to repleniſh them with the
<q rend="margQuotes">Truth of his Doctrine, adorn them with Innocency of Life, that both by Word and good Example, they may faithfully ſerve him in this Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then follow the Epiſtle and Goſpel; after which the Oath of Supremacy is given, and after that, an Exhortation to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their high Dignity, and weight of their Charge,
<hi>i.e.</hi> to be Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Watchmen, Stewards of the Lord, to teach, premoniſh, feed, provide for the Lord's Family, to ſeek Chriſt's Sheep that are diſperſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101841:25"/>abroad, and for his Children, who are in the midſt of this naughty World, that they may be ſaved through Chriſt for ever. Have always printed in your Memories, how great a Treaſure is committed to your Charge, the Sheep of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Covetous Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and negligent Reſidents is hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inſpection required, which ſome of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren call Goſſiping; others Conventicling.</note> bought with his Death — the Congregation which you ſerve is his Spouſe and his Body —. And if it ſhall happen any Member of that Church take any hurt by your Negligence, ye know the Greatneſs of the Fault, and alſo the horrible Puniſhment that will enſue—. See that you never ceaſe your Labour, your Care and Diligence, until you have done all that lieth in you, to bring all under your Charge, to Agreement in Faith, and Ripeneſs of Age in Chriſt, that there be no Error in Religion, or Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Life—; ye ought to pray earneſtly for his holy Spirit—, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how ſtudious you ought to be in reading and learning the Scriptures; and framing your Manners, and of yours, according to the Scriptures; and for this Cauſe ye ought to lay aſide all worldly Cares and Studies; we have good hope that you have clearly determined by God's Grace, to give your ſelves wholly to this Office, whereunto it hath pleaſed God to call you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is enough to prove their Fitneſs and their Call to the Miniſtry; and ſuch as are thus fitted, are admitted and ordained.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is ſo far from being any part of their Office, that it is altogether inconſiſtent with it, to diſturb the Peace, or ſow Sedition againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magiſtrates, or to derogate from their Authority, much more to do any ſuch thing againſt Chriſtian Magiſtrates that profeſs the Truth, to whom they are engaged by more and ſtricter Bonds.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Their Perſons and Eſtates are ſubject to the Magiſtrates Power and Laws, their Conſciences to God, and in him and for him, to them as his Ordinance; but to require more of them, than of other Subjects, carries in it a vehement Suſpicion, injurious to Religion, becauſe a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of them more than others.</p>
            <p n="11">11. They cannot impoſe themſelves upon any People, as their Teachers, but if any are deſirous of their Labours, or accept their Pains, and find benefit thereby, how can they that are given to the Work, refuſe to inſtruct and miniſter to them, any more than <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas,</hi> when conſtrained by the importunity of <hi>Lydia? Acts</hi>
16.15. Will it not inſtil an ill Opinion of our Rulers, and Laws, if they ſhall ſay, Good People, I would preach, inſtruct, exhort, and comfort you, but I dare not, I am forbidden, and it may coſt me my Liberty, and more than I am worth? Would it not be a ſowing of Sedition among the People, to tell them, Orthodox and faithful, and skilful Preachers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101841:26"/>dare not preach the Truth, no not in Corners, except to a very few!</p>
            <p n="12">12. Their Office is Divine, and their Calling not of Men, but of God, their chief Encouragements are ſpiritual and heavenly, but they ought to be protected, encouraged, and maintained, with all needful and competent Suſiſtence, for their bodily and miniſterial Support, and Comfort in their Work, and live of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Temporalities in the Donation of the Supream Powers, or private Patronage, may be given to whom they pleaſe, but ſtill as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God; they ſhould not be denied to Perſons fitted for the Work of the Miniſtry, nor given to Men more ſuitable to their Fancies, than the Mind of God: Magiſtrates and Patrons have Rules for their Direction, as Inferiours have for theirs.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And therefore Superiours have need of great Wiſdom and Wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſcern who are fit and worthy, and who not, and what are the neceſſary Conditions to capacitate Men, for the temporal Rewards and Subſiſtence, leſt by their unneceſſary Jealouſy, and Arbitrary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they reject Men that are furniſhed with the moſt neceſſary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Learning, and Holineſs, which contain Peace and Honeſty. Men that fear a Net, may ſtarve for want of Corn: It is hard Fare to ſwallow and eat Scruples of Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Governours may deprive Miniſters of their Temporal Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, remove them from their Stations for their Non-compliance with their Laws and Orders, but no humane Power can deprive them of what they could not give them, nor take away from them, <hi>viz.</hi> their miniſterial Abilities and Authority. I think it clear, nothing can eject them, or un-make them, but the Privation of thoſe things which could make them Miniſters.</p>
            <p>The Crimes for which Miniſters might be depoſed are, either Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, Unrighteouſneſs, and Immorality, few in Number, but groſs in Quality.</p>
            <p>And leſt I be thought too poſitive, let me propound ſome Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether thoſe Men who are fitted by Chriſt for the Miniſtry, that are moved and aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, that are devoted to Chriſt and his Work, that are invited to preach by many, that are moved with Compaſſion towards many People that want, that have had Succeſs in their Labours, are not obliged in Conſcience to preach the Goſpel, as often, as much, and to as many as they can?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it be a ſufficient Reaſon to refuſe to admit ſuch, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe able and worthy Men, or to eject and ſilence them, becauſe they cannot ſubſcribe, ſwear, declare, what a few Men, without asking Counſel
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101841:26"/>and Direction of God by ſolemn Faſting and Prayer, or by Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the fairly and equally choſen Repreſentatives of the whole Church, did reſolutely carry on by ways and Inſtruments of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing? We have our Ember Weeks for Ordination; and why not before framing Conditions, upon which, Continuance or Deprivation did depend of many hundreds of able Miniſters? I do not queſtion the lawful Authority of Governours, or detract from Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the Queſtion is, Whether Rulers ſhould wholly reject ſuch. Men as are duly qualified with Gifts neceſſary for the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, who refuſe no Catholick, but Conditions dubious in their Senſe, and unneceſſary in their nature and kind?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But granting that the Rulers of the Church, can juſtify to Chriſt their Rejection of qualified Men, which is not paſt doubt, from thoſe publick Stations and Endowments of the Church and charge of Souls; yet what Harm or Danger can come to precious Souls by the profitable and wholſome Labours of learned, judicious and ſound Chriſtian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, endowed with the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit of Chriſt, the Spirit of the Catholick Church? Why ſhould not they preach the Word? Why may not People hear them? Or, why ſhould not we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their Help, and repute them our Fellow-Labourers, and rejoyce in their Succeſs?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Have any of us that conform, heard any of them vent in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits in former times, while they had the Liberty of their Pulpits, any diſloyal, or rebellious Doctrine? any Fanaticiſm inconſiſtent with ſound Reaſon, and the Oracles of God, the Faith of the Catholick, or Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches? Name the Men, admoniſh them, labour to reclaim them, and teſtify againſt them. If they were ſuch Seeds-men, why did not the Church after her Reſtitution cite them, and proceed againſt them to Excommunication and Ejection, as intolerable Men? But on the contrary, Do we not remember our ſelves, and have we not heard others, remember what manner of Men they were, both in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and Countries? Do we not remember ſome of them, as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Colledges, as Tutors, as Preachers in the Univerſity, City and Country? and why may not they, who have been our Teachers, teach others? by whom we are ſaved and effectually called, by whom we believed, become bleſſed Inſtruments, and Miniſters, by whom others may believe, be born again, and ſaved. Is Nonconformity an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Spirit of Light. Truth, Purity, and Power in them? Doth Nonconformity ſeparate them from Chriſt? Are they none of his, becauſe they cannot ſubmit to the Inventions of ſome, who were not ſo much as Biſhops, when they vehemently coucurred to bring us to this paſs? and were reſtleſs to paſs ſome of their particular Problems
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101841:27"/>into a Law, to which all Men muſt declare Aſſent, if the Aſſent be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in their ſenſe. As I ſhould think it a great Sin, not to ſuccour my Father or Brother in want and diſtreſs; ſo I do think it a great Sin not to relieve my Fathers and Brethren in Jeſus Chriſt, by a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teſtimony, and Apology, when they are oppreſſed, and in danger of Priſons, Poverty, and many Miſeries. And let it be noted,<note place="margin">The like is gratefully acknowledged by the Godly and Reverend Biſhop if <hi>Co k,</hi> of a Nonconformiſt, <hi>p. 73.</hi>
               </note> that I am obliged to acknowledg the Efficacy of the Holy Spirit upon the preaching of ſeveral of them, towards my Salvation; and having known the proof, and Power of Chriſt ſpeaking in them, I dare not deny them before Men, leſt I alſo deny Chriſt Jeſus my Saviour in them. There are ſeveral lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, holy, laborious, and ſucceſsful Miniſters that were our Inſtructors in our younger time, who have conformed, but not ſo many as refuſed to conform, within my Knowledg, as I could name, but for offending them, and ſome other Reaſons of my Silence, and in thoſe times of Liberty, theſe ſeemed to be all of one Mind in the Lord. I and many more rejoyced in their Light; and ſome of them were among Preachers, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>As the Apple-Tree is among the Trees of the Wood;</hi> we ſate under their Shadow with great Delight, and their Fruit was pleaſant to our Taſte. I could name the wiſe Maſter-builders that laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, other than which no Man can lay; I could name the <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Apollos,</hi> and the <hi>Peters</hi> that preached to the Heart, the <hi>Barnabas</hi> and the <hi>Boanerges;</hi> the Friends of the Bridegroom, that woed and beſought us, and would not be denied till our Souls had received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord: ſome of them are at reſt in the Lord, and let their Names be bleſſed; and others are in the Cloud, and Storm, and Warfare; and to add Bonds to their many Afflictions is no ſmall unkindneſs to Religion. We know of what Spirit they were, that digg'd up the Bodies of <hi>Wikcliff,</hi> and other Saints; it is not hard to find of what Spirit they are, that rake into the Aſhes of the Dead, and ſprinkle them with their profane Wit, which is like Salt that has loſs its Savour, not good for the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil; it proceeds not from that Charity which covers a multitude of Sins.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether they who are called of God to the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſhould forſake and renounce their Calling, and look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Lay-men, and be but as Lay-men, becauſe they are ejected out of their Places, and conform not to the Injunctions of the Law? Many of the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> have Epiſcopal Ordination; ſhall they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all Miniſterial Acts, and do but what any Maſter of a Family ſhould do, inſtruct their own Family, and admit four more to a Participation of the Benefit? ſhall they renounce their Calling, who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101841:27"/>declared their Truſt, that they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to take the Office (of Deacon) whom the Arch-Deacon declared, when preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Prieſthood, he thought them apt and meet for their Learning and godly Converſation; and the Biſhop declared, after due Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, We find not the contary, but that <hi>they be lawfully called to their Function;</hi> for whom the Biſhop prayed, and whom he hoped, that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God's Grace to give <hi>them wholly to this Office, whereunto God hath called them;</hi> and alſo called to declare and profeſs (before God, Angels, and the Congregation) that they <hi>were truly called according to the Will of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> give faithful Diligence <hi>always</hi> ſo to miniſter the Doctrine and Sacraments, and the Diſcipline of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded, and this Church received according to the Commandments of God; to drive away erroneous Doctrines, to uſe <hi>both publick and private Monitions</hi> and Exhortations to ſick and whole within your Cures, as need ſhall require,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can any diſcharge them from God's Call, but God that called them? Can they ſit ſtill, and do no Miniſterial Work,<note place="margin">Theſe other Arguments are urged by heavenly Mr <hi>Joſ.

<hi>wholly</hi> to it? Or do they ceaſe to be Miniſters, except it be in that Cure to which they were inſtituted and inducted? Then are we made, tho not Independent, yet Congregational Miniſters, and are Miniſters only in that particular Congregation? If they ought not to renounce their Miniſtry, then they may preach, and do other Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Offices, as they have opportunity. Others are not Epiſcopally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; but if they are moved by the Holy Ghoſt, are learned, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Scriptures, are of Godly Converſation, and give themſelves to the Work, are not they called of God? If not, what's the meaning of the fore-cited Word in the ordering of Prieſts and Deacons;

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101841:29"/>as in a fit of Kindneſs is far from charging them with Schiſm,<note place="margin">Defence of Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſleet,</hi> pag. <hi>69.</hi>
               </note> if they would not leave the Church, but conform <hi>as Lay-men,</hi> as the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> did. But did the old
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> conform as Lay-men? So I ſuppoſe we all conform but as Lay-men, when we do not officiat as Miniſters; we anſwer as People anſwer, and do no more than People do. But I think the old
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> did reckon themſelves when they left their Livings, as much, and as truly Miniſters, as they did when they had their Livings, and did preach publickly by Connivance, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in moſt Counties. Our preſent <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> would thankfully accept the Favour, which moſt of the old did enjoy, till Conformity grew too hot even for many Conformiſts; I need not name the Times, nor the Planets that then bore Rule.</p>
            <p>But who can forbear lamenting the Condition of our Brethren, and of multitudes of precious Souls! Is there any Man qualiſied with a Competency of Learning, that can ſay, he is moved by the holy Ghoſt? that leads a good Life? that promiſeth to give himſelf to the Work of God? but ſhall be acknowledged by the Ordainer, to be called of God, even before he layeth on his Hands? but if this very ſame Man ſhall afterwards ſcruple, or refuſe, to aſſent to all and every thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall no longer be accounted by ſome Men, as a Man called of God, but muſt become again as a Lay-man, or elſe he cannot eſcape being a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick: which is enough to tempt a Man to think, that theſe make the Gift of Subſcribing, and the Faculty of aſſenting and conſenting to other Mens Inventions, to be the eſſentiating and conſtituting Qualification of a Miniſter, without which, tho he be never ſo well furniſhed with other Gifts, he ſhall be accounted but a Lay-man, and muſt do no more than a Lay-man, or elſe there's no avoiding the odious Crime of Schiſm. And hence this Notion may ariſe, like a Meteor in the Firmament of the Church, to be gazed upon, and afford matter of Obſervation, if not of Prediction. That Conformity to an Ordinance of Men doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and while he continneth in the ſame Mind he was in, at 24. Years of Age, all his life-time, and be not prepared to ſubmit to all after-Devices, that may be added, he ſhall fall from the Grace and Dignity of his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Miniſtry, and return to his firſt ſimple Being, of remotely diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed matter of meer Laity. If it be ſaid, no; for he being once ordained, he is a Miniſter of the Univerſal Church. Well, that's true; but if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conform to every Point, then he cannot exerciſe his Miniſtry in this Church: and then the Conſequence is obvious; ſuch are the Conditions of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry in the Church of <hi>England</hi> at this day, that a Miniſter of the Univerſal Church cannot exerciſe his Office, no not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101841:29"/>in any Chappel of Eaſd in this Kingdom, except he ſubmit to them; and if he cannot exercife his Miniſtry, after he is called unto it, what doth it profit him to be a Miniſter? or what is the Church the better for his Office? If one acknowledged to be a Miniſter of the Univerſal Church, may not adminiſter in a particular Church, then is it not becauſe that particular Church requires ſome Conditions, which are not ſo large as the Rules and Conditions of the Univerſal Church? This may put us to ſearch whether different Rules, ſtricter Laws preſcribed, as Conditions of Entrance and Continuance in the Miniſtry, and Church-Communion, be not the Cauſe or Occaſion of Schiſms in particular Churches? Theſe Catholick Rules and Conditions are to be taken, and received from the Apoſtles, who went into all the World to gather, and to found Chriſtian Churches. They gave us Laws enow to govern any particular Church, who were ſent into all the World: And no Decrees of General Councils are of equal Obſervation with the Scriptures, not only becauſe of their Sanctity, but becauſe of their Univerſality; and the very Errors and Miſtakes of them in ſome Particulars are tolerable, that do what they can to find out and follow the Will of God in Scripture.</p>
            <p>And this Diverſity can be no Inconvenience to any Church, becauſe of the plain Injunctions and Commands of keeping the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, of loving, and forbearing one another in Love.</p>
            <p>But to return, What ſhall we ſay? Are they but Lay-men, or but
<hi>quaſi</hi> Lay-men, that were once ordained by <hi>Dioceſans?</hi> or what it others can prove by the Holy Scriptures, and the Catholick Rules of Faith, that they are called of God, and make proof of their Gifts, which make there ſerviceable to the Souls of poor Sinners, and only ſcruple ſome late im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating perplexing Terms, what ſhall they do in this caſe? They would enter into the Service, according to the uncontroverted general Rules of Chriſt, the Soveraign Law-giver of his Church; but that will not ſerve the turn, they muſt do more: They have received Gifts from the Spirit, of the ſame nature with other Miniſters, they'l ſubmit their Gifts to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to free them from the Fanaticiſm imputed to them. Theſe Gifts are for ſome uſe; they are their Talents, and they muſt give an account of them to the Giver of them at his appearing. Whither can any of them go, and not be ſerviceable? Is there any City, Town, Pariſh, or noble Family in
<hi>England,</hi> in which there is not need, or where ſuch as they may not be exceeding profitable? but in ſome Places, there is a crying need! O how few, few Labourers are there in very large Fields! yea, as offenſive as the preſence of the Brethren are in many places, there is not an uſeleſs Man among them, nor one place hardly where is not need, if not extream need. What ſhall they do? conform to the Church
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101841:30"/>as Lay-men only! What if the Bottle be ſo full, that its ready to burſt? what if the Fire of Zeal, true Zeal, kindle? muſt they not ſpeak with their Tongue! What if the Breaſt be full, and they who were begorten in Chriſt Jeſus by their Miniſtry, cry, cry to them; <hi>O give us of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Milk of the Word!</hi> ſhall they ſay, No, my Breaſt is full, but I muſt not draw it out? What if they have Bread enough, and can divide it, and ſee a Company of poor Souls ready to ſtarve, and pine for Want, and yet they muſt not give them a piece of Bread? City Miniſters are moſt quarelſome and contentious with them; but if from their high Places they ſaw and knew but what I know, inſtead of charging them with Separation and Schiſm, they would beg of Authority, that they would ſend them into many places of the Land, which are more like a Wilderneſs, than the Garden of the Lord: but inſtead of doing this, ſome have written to prepare a prejudiced People to entertain them with Stones; or beſeech them to depart out of their Coaſts; and not to open their Doors to entertain them, or their Ears to hear them. Oh! how are many of the Servants of God, true Subjects, able Preacers, at this day forced to hide, and many are as ſhy, and cloſe to entertain them, as if they were Traitors, and the Hue and Cry were out againſt them!</p>
            <p>But what if theſe Men cannot think themſelves diſcharged of their Work, when their Hire is ſtopt? they cannot but pity thoſe that have no Shepherds, or not enow; they cannot ſtop their Ears againſt the Cry of the poor; what if Conſcience cry, <hi>Wo to me, if I preach not the Goſpel!</hi> O there are too many that never heard that Preaching in their Boſom. Some have pleaded that Wo concerned none but the Apoſtle; what ſhall they do between two Woes? Wo from Chriſt if I preach not, and Wo from Men if I preach!</p>

The Champions of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in former days againſt the Papiſts were moderate, when we know there was a different way of Diſcipline and Decency ſecretly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. If Doctrine be the direction of Practice, to be moderate in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but ſevere in Practice and Execution, is to put out the Candle, and kindle a Fire; to preach Charity, but to ſhew no Mercy.</p>
            <p>To draw towards a Concluſion; Let us but truly judg of the elder
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> with righteous Judgment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Before his Majeſtie's wonderful Reſtauration, in all Countries and Places where they lived and preached, who did rebuke, reprove, exhort, and fulfil all parts of Minſters more than they? Who maintained Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrines, preached for Conviction, Converſion, Holineſs and Righteouneſs more than they? Who vindicated all Ordinances from ſome that pretended to live above them? Others that denied the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and uſe of them? and from the Profanation of ſacred Things? And who did more forwardly aſſiſt and concur to ſettle the Government upon ancient Foundations, and in the Inheritor of the Royal Throne? Who were more hated by impious Sects, or that laboured more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and reduce them, than they?</p>
            <p n="2">2. At that time, and ſince, how highly were they placed in the King's good Opinion? as is fully expreſſed in his Royal Declaration.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101841:33"/>
            <p n="3">3. They did ſhew a Forwardneſs and Zeal to ſettle the Church, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own private Opinions, to lay down ſolid Foundations for a Comprehenſive Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When they quietly ſubmitted to the Law of their Ejectment; did they, did any of them ſow Sedition, or ill Principles of Faction? was their Exhortation of deceit or guile? to incenſe their loving Auditors, or oblige and conjure them to any thing inconſiſtent with the Goſpel? or unlike Men, as going from the Pulpit, to God's Tribunal, to give him an Account of their Doctrine, Faith, manner of Life? ſee any of their broken Notes, and Farewell-Sermons, printed much to their Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage! Teſtify againſt them who can!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Except they had renounced their ſacred Calling, and ſilenced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who could have imployed their Labours with more inoffenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Authority, more Toil to themſelves, and more Profit to precious Souls, and leſs Oppoſition to the publick than they did? (as will appear in Inſtances) An honourable Member (Sir <hi>H. C. Anno</hi> 1670,
71) in full Parliament took notice of it that there were no Conventicles: yes, they took pains to preach, when others were at reſt in great Privacies and Solitudes. And let's be juſt: who hath made any Obſervation of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Aſſairs, that will not ſay, for one Schiſmatick we had had many, had it not been for their great Induſtry; and who for all that are Schiſmaticks but they!<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Say to <hi>Archippus</hi> p. <hi>23. ſcil.</hi> your not p eaching will occaſion Separation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> It is not Thanks-worthy to keep poor weak Souls in the Faith and Truth, except they turn Lay-men, and all come up even to the Rails,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to the heighth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God and the King made their Aſſemblies ſo numerous and publick; God by a tremendous courſe of Judgments, yet remembring Mercy: The King, after 12 Years Experience of fruitleſs Severity, ſent out his Declaration of Indulgence. Some of themſelves have publiſhed the Providence of God, but it is not worth the noting; and they that are reſolved on their way, will not be hindred by making Obſervation, even of the Works of God. When God ſent a dreadful Plague, and the Angel ſtood over <hi>London</hi> with his drawn Sword, as our <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> then the King, and Court, and Parliament removed to <hi>Oxford;</hi> and when many Churches were empty, God ſtirred up many of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to go and preach up and down; then they had the uſe of Churches, and numerous Aſſemblies, and gained many Souls to God by them, and drew the Hearts of a deſolate People to themſelves, which could never ſince be alienated from them. And when the Popiſh Faction oppoſed by the Loyal Perſons, got an Act to remove them from Corporations; they were then moſt imployed in the Capital City in ſpight of their Adverſaries, and God protected them, and the Plague
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101841:33"/>proved their Sanctuary from that Law. Next Year the City was burnt, and the Inhabitants of the principal Parts of it were driven into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> had the advantage! Who that knew them would not entertain them as Comforters, in a diſtracted ruined Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! Then the Conformiſts were driven out of Churches too, and ſome felt the loſs of Livings, to teach them Compaſſion towards their ejected Brethren; and the common Enemy of them both ſhewed the World what he would do with us, as well as them: And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if now the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> could be rooted out, the Church-men ſhall not ſtand long after them; no, tho they ſhould, which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, comply with them. Popiſh Mercy is like raging Fire, takes all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and even turning ſhall not ſave us; and they who are ſo offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſerve their Intereſt now, may not come off ſo well with their Reward as
<hi>Adonibezek</hi> did. Many ſuffered great Loſſes, lived in great danger and diſtraction by that Corporation-Act, but the Enactors could never accompliſh their full deſign by it; the very Souldiers that were imployed to keep out People, and to guard the Meeting-places, were not pleaſed with their Office, and ſhewed Civility to the Miniſters in ſome places. Their Sufferings went againſt the common ſenſe of Men: but ſo captions were ſome Men, ſo zealous, rather ſo jealous, to juſtify their Reſolutions, that ſtrange Stories were carried, and diſperſed of ſeditious Doctrines, Preachers were preſented as Incendiaries, to incenſe the Magiſtrate againſt them; that it was dangerous for the Preachers to quote ſome Texts of Scriptures; and juſt cauſe there is why ſuch unchriſtian Spirits ſhould be afraid of Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="7">7. After all this Diſtraction and Trouble, His Majeſty ſent out his Declaration of Indulgence, and they became licenſed Preachers. It is true, the Parliament at their next meeting declared againſtit, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Laws, and his Majeſty called it in; but it proved, and proves profitable to the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The very Parliament that was againſt the Declaration, continued rather favourable towards the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> than ſharp; the Laws continued, but the Execution cooled and abated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as built Tabernacles and the moſt convenient Places they could, held them, and their Congregations ſtuck to them, and both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Moleſtation, until now, that their <hi>old Friend</hi> awakes as one out of ſleep, leſt they ſhould ſow good Seed in the Field.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though that Declaration of Indulgence,<note place="margin">Nor could at that time, as is to be ſeen in what follows of the Sufferings of the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts.</hi>
               </note> and the Licences granted them, cannot protect them from the Arreſts of Mens Paſſions, nor from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hands of ſuch (as are like <hi>Saul</hi>'s) againſt them; yet they do clearly vindicate them from the odious
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101841:34"/>Slander of ſeditious and evil Men. For can it be thought that the King would have ſo little regard to Truth, Faith, Peace, to his own Safety, and the Preſervation of his Subjects from the infection of wicked and curſed Principles, as to grant Licences to ſeditious Preachers, to Doctors of Rebellion, or Underminers of Church and State? they are moſt the ſaine Men, who were licenſed by the King; if the King was deceived in them; if they are dangerous and evil Men, teſtify againſt them, and no greater Favour is deſired for them, but Truth and Juſtice. Let them that clamor againſt them and aſperſe them, do it, and preſerve their Honour and Reverence of the King immaculate if they can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtianum eſſe (Nonconformiſtam eſſe) aut eſt Crimen, aut non eſt; ſo Crimen eſt, cur non interficis confitentem? ſi Crimen non eſt, quid perſequeris innocentem? Cyp. contra Demetrianum.</hi> Tract. 1.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for that, by way of Apology; now follows the ſecond Query.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it be not hard to ſilence, ſuppreſs, and puniſh the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> for endeavouring the everlaſting Salvation of precious Souls by their Preaching and other Religious Exerciſes?</p>
            <p>I cannot call to mind more than three things that can be urged againſt them, or to juſtify their Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They tranſgreſs the Laws and Orders of the Church, made by the Biſhops, Rulers, and Fathers of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They tranſgreſs againſt the Statutes of the Land, and why ſhould they be priviledged or ſpared if they tranſgreſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are Men uncalled to preach the Goſpel; and it is fit ſuch Men ſhould be reſtrained.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, It may be anſwered, waving the Diſputes about Church-Rulers, and the Reſtriction of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; that the preſent Terms of Miniſterial Liberty were not the Reſult and Decrees of all the Biſhops of the Church after Conſultation and free debate, ſuppoſing all the Power to be lodged in them; but we know that our Eccleſiaſtical Laws are made by our Convocation, and enacted and eſtabliſhed by the Civil Power; whether there was any Debate or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation about theſe Impoſitions, is not altogether unknown. We read that in the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> met to conſider a Caſe, as plain and eaſy as any of our Matters can be ſuppoſed to be, that they came not to a Determination, till after much diſputing, there was nothing but open dealing. The Apoſtle of the Circumciſion did not proteſt againſt the Apoſtle of the Uncircumciſion, as unfit to be there, no tart
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101841:34"/>Reprehenſions or Magiſterial Checks were given, but what concerned the whole Church, was debated by the whole Church, the Apoſtles and Elders, and the Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi>
15.6, 7, 22.</note> and nothing reſolved; but after Conſideration and Diſputation, they give the Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> an account of their Conſultation, and lay upon them none but neceſſary things, without either Penalty or Sanction, but this, <hi>from which, if you keep your ſelves ye ſhall do well.</hi> I cannot think that the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth reflect upon all, or moſt of the Biſhops,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi>
29.</note> by his frequent mention of <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius,</hi> but well knows our Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be <hi>the Will and Pleaſure</hi> of but a ſmall number of them; and if it be ſo, we may queſtion the Right which a few Biſhops had to make Laws for the whole Church, till we ſee their Patent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But they tranſgreſs other Temporal Laws made by lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 1. A lawful Authority is made up of ſeveral Eſtates in this Kingdom; whereof one is choſen by the free Votes of the People of ſuch a rank, as have an Intereſt in the Land. I have heard ſome doubt, whether that Houſe of Commons were ſo truly, their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, becauſe many of them were obtruded upon the People, and many indirect and unlawful ways were taken to ſort them together. But 2. wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that, ſucceeding Parliaments have marked out theſe Laws to give them an Expiration; and were it not for Fomentations, and high Drops uſed by ſome, to keep them in Life and Vigor, they had been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in neglect by this time. 3. But granting they are in as full force as ever; yet Laws are compared to the Grape, which being too much preſſed, yieldeth an hard and <hi>unwholſome</hi> Wine; as the wiſe Lord Chancellor<note n="‖" place="margin">Wiſe and moderate Diſcourſe concerning Church-Affairs, <hi>p. 37.</hi>

               <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid. To preſs out ſuch a Wine, and force an exhauſted party to pay dearly for it, is not the way to nouriſh good Blood in ſuch a diſeaſed Body as ours is. But having ſpoken of this in the <hi>Second Plea,</hi> I ſhall add no more here, but reſerve ſomething for a Poſtſcript, concerning what I ſaid in that.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt Prejudice againſt them is, that they are Men uncalled to preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer;</hi> All of the Seniors of them had Epiſcopal Ordination; others have another kind, and moſt, if not all I plead for, have the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and I dare ſay, would chearfully anſwer all the Interrogatories in the Examnation, in the ordering of Prieſts, except a part of the laſt. But my Anſwer is, that when the calling of Miniſters hath been doubted of, or queſtioned, as the calling of our Biſhops and Miniſtry hath been by the Papiſts, Our moſt Reverend Fathers have inſiſted upon one certain Rule of Trial of true Miniſters and Paſtors.

                  </note> my Brethren, ſhall you ſoon try, whether they are the true Servants of God; for if they ſhall only diſcloſe unto you the Will of God, if they ſhall preach unto you the Secrets of God's Goſpel, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his holy Name, then are they true Servants, then are they Chriſt's Miniſters, and faithful Diſpenſers of God's Secrets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In theſe our days the Miniſters of God, and Preachers of his Goſpel, are evil ſpoken of among all Men; ſome ſay, they are unlearned, they are Crafts-men—. Some ſay they preach they cannot tell what; they ſpeak againſt Prayer, Faiting, Alms-deeds, and all other good Works—. Unto all this I ſay, it is ſufficient for us to be found the Servants of God, and faithful Diſpenſers of God's Secrets. When <hi>Paul</hi> came from
<hi>Berea</hi> to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and began to preach the Goſpel there, the People ran to their Books, ſearched the Scriptures, and when they found in all Points they agreed therewith, then they believed
<hi>Paul</hi>—. Even ſo let us do, good Brethron—; let us examine and try their Doctrine with the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of God's Word, and confer their Teaching, their Diſcipline with the Scriptures of the Holy Ghoſt—, and then be you Judges; then if you ſee that we teach you nothing but the Myſteries of God;<note place="margin">

It is no wonder that People are abuſed into a Suſpicion, that their Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is but a Pretence, a conſcientious Diſguiſe to cover Rebellious Principles; that they began the War, which was as impoſſible, as it is hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically untrue: That they preach in Barns, and other places, out of diſlike of Churches. I ſuppoſe, if they were offered Churches, they would not refuſe them: But as Conventicles are counted as places of Diſgrace, ſo it's an Unhappineſs they have no better, and a greater, that they may not have
<hi>them.</hi> His Goſpel who was laid in a Manger, may be preached in a Barn, if there be no room for his Preachers in better places. The Primitive Chriſtians were glad of any places. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi>

            <p>Theſe Prejudices caſt out of the way, it were eaſy to out match theſe Prejudices; but I will not uſe a hand to record what is not to be heard without Trouble; but it is not unfit to take notice of ſo much as belongs to the Queſtion in hand; and no more than will ſerve to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Mens Minds to believe there are Complaints, which ſhould affect and move the Hearts of our Rulers, to hearken to the Motions of the Reconcilers, and Peace-makers. And that I may handle a tender Point, with as much Tenderneſs and Modeſty even towards them, that make the Hearts of Chriſtians groan and mourn, I'll proceed by Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What had the Pariſhes and Congregations of

               </note> It muſt be confeſſed, we all had ſinned; but moſt notoriouſly two ſorts of People; firſt, thoſe that could not endure ſound Doctrine, nor Reproofs, and hate to be reformed; and others, who knew not the time of the Viſitation, were too ſleepy and luke-warm, and could too eaſily part with thoſe who laboured to win them, and bring them to God by Repentance, Faith and Love. Could they put in better in their rooms? Was there too many, and could hundreds be ſpared? then why had ſome one Man many Livings? Was it becauſe there were too many? or why might not many that ſeldom or never well could preach, be rather maintained, and eaſed? Was this to do as our Saviour commanded, <hi>Pray ye to the Lord of the Harveſt to ſend Labourers into his Harveſt?</hi> See Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi>'s Sermon on that Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What had the Preachers done to merit ſilencing? I could fill up my Page with Queries; but I will keep cloſe to the general Point. If they will not ſubſcribe, declare, and ſwear ſuch preſcribed Forms; they are judged by the Law to be mute. The beſt is, they diſſented from the Law; without Impeachment of their Loyalty to the King, for they would gladly have ſubmitted to his Terms, and could not obey the Law, without any great Diſhonour to the Legiſlative Power, for they only diſſent from a few Men, who then could ſway enow to do their Work.</p>

Whether Aſſent and Conſent, to ſome human Laws, Rites and Ceremonies, upon which neither Faith, nor Unity depends, be not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made more neceſſary for Exerciſe and Practice, than the aſſenting to Articles of Faith, or than preaching the Goſpel, or by conſequence, the Salvation of Immortal Souls? It is true, there is a vaſt difference in the nature of the things; but as to Capacity and Incapacity to miniſter in the holy Office, it is all one, for a Man to refuſe Aſſent and Conſent to every thing, as it is to an Article of the Creed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Or that Conformity to Order, and the uſe of the Liturgy, a monthly Sermon, or a Homily, is more for the Edification of the Church, than diligent and conſtant preaching, without a particular Aſſent to all, every thing? Which (I will freely ſpeak it) can be affirmed by none, but a Man that ſets light by his own Salvation, and never perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with his own Flock, or knows the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, or Eternal Life, or the Practice of the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have laboured to open the nature of the Cauſe of theſe Proceedings againſt our Proteſtant Brethren, and it is their Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, paſſive and active; the firſt of which is a refuſal of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Terms of Church-Freedom; the ſecond is a worſhipping of God in Chriſt, according to the Rule of the Holy Scripture, as nearly as they can diſcern it; and after the common, either allowed, or not diſallowed manner of the Reformed Proteſtant Churches, and particular this of <hi>England:</hi> And in what they do, they follow the ſame Rule, and act from the ſame Principles, which our firſt Reformers profeſſed, and their learned Defenders have maintained: And three Queſtions ſhall take up the whole of what's to follow.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101841:37"/>
            <p n="1">1. Whether they, the Proteſtant <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> juſtly deſerve to be ſilenced, ſuppreſſed, and puniſhed, as they have been, and are?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether they are not at leaſt to be permitted, and indulged?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether we ought not to unite and become one, by removal, or abating the things, that divide and break us? ſo that we may hold mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and actual Communion in the ſame Exerciſes of Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of offending our Superiours thereby, or any other?</p>
            <p>So much hath not been ſpoken of the firſt Queſtion in the
<hi>Second Plea,</hi> but that much more may be produced, to encline, if not draw the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reader to the right ſide of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is clear that they are not depoſed and proſecuted for ſuch Crimes as were meritorious of Depoſition in the Ancient Church by their Canons; thoſe Crimes were Fornication, Perjury, Theft.
<q rend="margQuotes">Let a Biſhop, Presbyter, or Deacon, convicted of Fornication, Perjury, or Theft, be depoſed, but with caution that he be not ſeparated,</q>
               <note place="margin">Canons, called the Apoſtles Canons.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> from the Communion of the Faithful, as
<hi>Balſamon</hi> expounds, <hi>&amp; non ſegregetur;</hi> adding a Reaſon for this Moderation, that no Man be puniſhed twice for the ſame Fault, as ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.9. as the learned Mr.
<hi>Beveredge,</hi> in his Notes upon thoſe Canons, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Is it likely theſe ſhould be Canons of the Apoſtles, contrary to 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11? Or if they be genuine and ancient, how diſagreeing is the modern Uſage of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> who are convicted of no ſuch Crimes, according to the ancient Canons, but yet who are for their Nonconformity puniſhed in ſeveral Courts, and ſeveral times, and ways? Depoſition is judged Puniſhment ſufficient, ſaith <hi>Zonaras;</hi> ſo <hi>Ariſtenus,</hi> for to ſubject to a double puniſhment,
<hi>omnino inhumanum eſt,</hi> is altogether inhuman.
<q rend="margQuotes">Other Canons command a Biſhop, Presbyter or Deacon to be depoſed, that beat offending Believers, or Infidels, that have done wrong. <hi>Can.</hi> 27. If a Biſhop, Presbyter or Deacon obtain his Dignity with Money, let him be depoſed, and he that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him; <hi>Can.</hi> 29. If a Biſhop have made uſe of Secular Princes to obtain a Church, let him be depoſed, and excommunicated. If a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, contemning his own Biſhop, ſhall ſeparate from him, and ſet up an Altar without Cauſe, or blameleſs, either in reſpect of Religion, or Juſtice, let him be depoſed; <hi>Can.</hi> 31.</q> But this is not the Caſe of our <hi>Nonconformiſts. Duarenus</hi> reckons the depoſing and ejecting Crimes to be, 1. Simoniacal Ambition. 2. Incontinency. 3. Perjury. 4. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter. 5. Treaſon. 6. Or beſides theſe Crimes, any
<hi>legal</hi> Infamy. But <hi>Panormitan</hi> admoniſheth, that they were not to obſerve the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ancient Canons, becauſe the Men of this Age, are not like <hi>thoſe ancient Men,</hi> or Men of ancient Times.

            <p n="2">2. In what they do, they proceed upon Principles common to all Chriſtians, and Proteſtant Churches, in taking the Word of God for their Rule, as a divine and perfect Rule.
<q rend="margQuotes">The Chriſtian Faith, as they (of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) had explained it, was <hi>a Submiſſion to the Church.</hi> The Reforming, finding that this was the Spring of all their Errors, and that which gave them Colour and Authority, did on the other hand, ſet up the Strength of their whole Cauſe on an explicit believing the Truth of Scriptures, becauſe of the Authority of God, who had revealed them, ſaith the Reverend Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>—.</q>

<q rend="margQuotes">They who began the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, laboured in tranſlating, and publiſhing the Scriptures; and would have all their Doctrines tried by them. The Reverend <hi>Bilſon</hi> bids the Papiſts, Prove your Religion and Service (which you ſtoutly and falſely term Catholick) to be commanded by Chriſt, or elſe Women and Children, be they never ſo ſilly, will collect by the manifeſt Words of our Saviour, that their Promiſe in Baptiſm, doth ſtraitly bind them from believing your Errors, and admitting your Maſſes, until you ſhew good and effectual Warrant out of the Word of God, that you do what Chriſt did, and teach what he taught, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding or altering any jot.</hi> For this is the Duty that Baptiſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us, to believe no Teacher but one, which is Chriſt, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no Stranger, to regard and obey no Lord or Law-maker in the Church, but only the Son, whom the Father appointed to be Maſter and Leader,<note place="margin">Subject, part <hi>1.</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion,

            <p n="3">3. According to this Rule and Principle, they frame their Worſhip, and model their Government and Diſcipline, and they that keep to that, though by different Schemes, having their Flaws and Failings, they cannot err a damnable Error; and if not damnable, it is want of Charity that will judg it intolerable. And there are thoſe General Rules

It is a hard Caſe to puniſh all Men that are not of the ſame Complexion, or that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee alike clearly, tho they walk with us in the ſame way, of Faith, and Holineſs, and Peace. The Church of Chriſt never bred <hi>that Notion,</hi> that Church-Unity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion doth conſiſt in Accidents, no more than Humane Nature, in Complexion, Shape, Stature; or of Children in Cloaths of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Faſhion Length,

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And once again; they are puniſhed for Nonconformity; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what hath been ſaid elſewhere, in particular; beſides the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the wicked Deſign, Sedition, Rebellion and Schiſm, and the odious Pretence, take the Law in the Stricteſt Senſe of it, <hi>and any Exerciſe of Religion in other manner, than according to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of</hi> England, ſeems to be forbidden by it. It ſeems to be unſafe for any to puniſh upon this Law; and it is hard to be puniſhed by it; it ſignifies ſomething, but certainly what, is very dubious. For in the Liturgy, <hi>i. e.</hi> Book of Common-Prayer, there are two things only. 1. Rules, Directions, and Orders, called Rubricks. 2. The Parts of the Worſhip and Ceremonies, ordered, preſcribed, and directed by them. It ſeems the meaning of the Law is, That no other Exerciſe of Religion ſhall be lawful without the Common-Prayer, both Matter and Rites, according to the Rubrick; but then, the Words of the Act agree not; becauſe the Practice of the Church, in many Places, is different from the manner of the Liturgy, as others have proved by Inſtances. The Practice of all Cathedrals may not be alike, for ought I know. The Practice of the Cathedral and Pariſh-Churches, are not the ſame, as all Men know; nor of one Pariſh like another, while ſo many go beyond the Rule; the Practice of ſome Churches, and Colledge-Chappels, and ſome Chappels differ from others; ſome reading all <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Canticles</hi> and Chapters on
<hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays;</hi> and others reading on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome Prayers and the Litany:<note n="*" place="margin">And this is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Q <hi>Eliz.</hi> days,
<hi>Vid.</hi> Injunct <hi>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, An. 1559.</hi>
               </note> And yet the Law for all theſe places is the ſame. The Law is uniform, but the Practice multiform: But if
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101841:38"/>the uſe of the book, both Rules and Things ordered by it, be enjoined, then it ſeems ſtrange that the Words ſhould be <hi>after the manner of the Church of</hi> England; for ſuppoſe any ſhould compoſe a Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, begin with ſome apt Sentences of Scripture, then go to an Exhortation to Confeſſion, but uſe another Confeſſion; and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerve the Rubrick, but not the ſame number of Pſalms, nor the ſame Canticles, and Leſſons, or one of the three, or ancient Creeds, and other Prayers; whether this would not be, tho not the ſame things, yet after the manner of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as being after the ſame Order. But take the words as before, That no Exerciſe of Religion to above four and the Family ſhall be lawful, except they uſe the Common-Prayer. Then may ſome be apt to think, that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is a Conformity allowed by this Act, to overthrow and weaken that required by the Act of Uniformity. I query; If a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall in any publick place, ſo he be neither Parſon, Vicar, or Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendary, read the Common-Prayer, altho he do not ſubſcribe, nor declare Aſſent and Conſent, whether he may not lawfully preach to as large an Aſſembly as will hear him? And ſo may not a Man that is a
<hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> in reſpect of Subſcription and Declaration, lawfully preach, as publickly as he can? and ſo be a legal <hi>Nonconforming Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt;</hi> as honeſt Mr. <hi>C.</hi> called himſelf; and whether this Act doth not ſtrike at the Act of Uniformity?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doth it not caſt an ill look upon all other Modes of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as if no other Form were conſiſtent with the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but what is according to the Liturgy?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all that diſſent from all things in the Liturgy, are Perſons to be ſuſpected of the King, except ſuch as ſay, or hear the Liturgy, and for that Cauſe are not; and by Conſequence, whether the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it doth not clearly tend to divide between the King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and between Subject and Subject; yea, to make them that are religious appear more formidable than the irreligious?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And whether it is not to ſet up a manner of Worſhip compoſed by Men, above the <hi>matter of Worſhip</hi> appointed by God? for let the Worſhip as to the Matter and End and Principle be divine, it is not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, except it be after that one Manner and Practice. I'll add no more Doubts and Prejudices, but come to plain Argument.</p>
            <p>They who ought to be encouraged and protected by the King of
<hi>England,</hi> as Supream Governour, ought not to be puniſhed:<note place="margin">☜</note> But our Proteſtant <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ought to be encouraged and protected: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who ſet up no falſe and Idolatrous Worſhip, contrary to the Word of God, that worſhip God according to his Word, ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101841:39"/>and protected by the King of <hi>England,</hi> as Supream Governour, and his Laws. But ſuch is their Worſhip (in every part;) Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'll touch the <hi>Minor</hi> firſt, and then go to the Propoſition: That Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which agrees in the right Object, of Scripture-matter, according to Scripture, and to divine Ends, is true Worſhip: but ſuch is their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To multiply no more Syllogiſms; I prove the Propoſition by the conſtant Uniform, allowed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And to ſtrike home at one blow, thus I argue:</p>
            <p>They who ought to be encouraged and protected, and not puniſhed, according to the <hi>allowed Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> explaining the King's Supremacy, ought not to be puniſhed by any new or ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Law, that doth not condemn that allowed Doctrine of the Church, as this Act doth not.

<hi>England,</hi> explaining the King's Supremacy; they, and ſuch as they, are to be encouraged and protected: Therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="2">2. Permiſſion and Indulgence is the loweſt degree of Favour that can be ſhewed to Catholick Chriſtians and Proteſtants in a Chriſtian Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If more be due to the Profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, yea, of the Proteſtant Religion: Then a Permiſſion, or Indulgence, is the leaſt Reſpect and Favour due to it. But more is due to it than Permiſſion; therefore that's the leaſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Permiſſion was due to Godlineſs and Honeſty from adverſe Powers, both Jewiſh and Heathen; and if it be due to Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101841:40"/>in Popiſh Countries; then it is much more due to Proteſtant Profeſſors in Proteſtant Kingdoms and States: But the former is true; therefore much more the latter.</p>
            <p>Of theſe in particular:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Jewiſh Powers ought to have permitted the preaching of the Goſpel to our Saviour and his Apoſtles, becauſe it was of God; and God hath Soverign Power in all the World, to ſet up his Kingdom, and Laws. It was the Sin of the Jews to forbid the preaching of the Goſpel; it was a Duty in the Apoſtles to preach it, even when forbidden. If it was a Sin in the Jews to forbid it, they ought certainly to permit it; yea, they ought to have received, and obeyed it. If it had been a Duty, (and no Sin) in the Jews to forbid the preaching of Chriſt, it had been a Sin in the Apoſtles notwithſtanding, and againſt that Prohibition, to preach it. But it was an Obedience to God (the higher Power) to preach it; therefore they who forbad it, ought to permit it, yea much more, it was their Duty to believe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame Reaſon will hold all the World over; becauſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion is from God, and teaches the Knowledg, and Obedience, and Worſhip of God, and the way to Life; therefore God may ſend it all over the World by Men called and ſent by him, without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Powers of the World. And if Men knew the Gift of God, they ought to eſteem it the greateſt Mercy, and manifeſtation of Grace, that was ever ſhewed to the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour commands his Apoſtles to go into all the World, to preach the Goſpel to every Creature. It comes among them without their Knowledg, and againſt their Wills: Ought it to be received or not? if not, then God ought not to be obeyed according to his revealed Will, which no Man dare affirm: if it ought to be received, it ought to be permitted and indulged with an overplus of Reverence and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Godlineſs and Honeſty was to be priviledged, and protected, to be cheriſhed, ard not extinguiſhed in Heathen Kingdoms: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. They deſired to lead quiet Lives, free from Trouble and Perſecution, the uſe they were to make, and did make of their Quietneſs, was the Exerciſe of Godlineſs and Honeſty. To this end they were to pray for Kings, and all in Authority: And Kings, and all in Authority, may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and not fear to give Protection and Security to all that pray for them, and that live in Godlineſs and Honeſty under them. If pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Quietneſs might be expected from Heathens, much more from Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Refermed Chriſtians ought to be permitted in Popiſh Kingdoms and States; then Chriſtians profeſſing the Reformation, may be much more permitted in Proteſtant Kingdoms and States, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101841:41"/>in this Kingdom. Popiſh Kings and Rulers ought to receive, and obey the Truth, and to believe no more than what Chriſt hath commanded to be believed, and to worſhip God according to the Will of Chriſt. Shall we ſay the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> do not hold the Faith, nor worſhip God according to the Goſpel? then what are they who ſay ſo? If they profeſs and believe the Truth, they ought to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that's plain, for the Truth's ſake, and for the Lord's ſake. Doth Chriſtian Love and Compaſſion prompt us, to wiſh our perſecuted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>France</hi> enjoyed the Liberty of the true Religion there? and if they ſhould enjoy a Freedom there, ſhall we deny a Liberty to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Brethren here? I can ſee no way to avoid a Juſtification of the barbarous Uſage of Proteſtants there, by them that proſecute Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants here, for far leſſer Differences from our Eſtabliſhments, than theirs from the Papiſts. Suppoſe an Embaſſador was ſent to treat with the <hi>French</hi> King, at this time of Proſecution of our Native Proteſtants, for a Ceſſation of that cruel Perſecution: how readily might an Anſwer be made, Why may not I ſuppreſs Hereticks, when in <hi>England</hi> you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Proteſtants?</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Diverſity of Order and Manner of Diſcipline and Worſhip, may be as well permitted without breach of Church-Unity in the ſame Nation, as in divers Nations, without breach of Chriſtian and Catholick Unity. If <hi>different Forms</hi> of Belief are allowed, the matter being divine, and the one more large and explicit than others; why may not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Modes and Order of Diſcipline and Worſhip be allowed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? Our Worſhip is according to our Faith; as we believe, ſo we worſhip: Notwithſtanding our uſe of three Forms of Profeſſion of our Faith, we agree in one Faith; ſo in different Forms of Worſhip we agree in one Evangelical Worſhip: And our Reformers might with as great Reaſon have pitched upon one of the three Creeds, and for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity ſake, required Aſſent to that, and the uſe of that and no other, as our Modern Fathers pitch upon one Form of Worſhip, and require our Aſſent and Uſe of that, and no other. For Uniformity in Faith is more neceſſary than Uniformity in Orders and Rites. We uſe the Creed called the Apoſtles,
<hi>Athanaſian,</hi> and <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> hath written a larger Form, in his Apology for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> agreeing in Words with neither; and, in his Reply to <hi>Harding,</hi> reckons up eight Forms, compoſed by ſeveral Authors and Fathers.<note place="margin">Apol. 2d part, <hi>1. c.</hi> Diviſ. <hi>1.</hi> Diverſity of Creeds, <hi>fol. 38.</hi>

               <hi>Harding,</hi> cavilling againſt his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Faith, (as many in our days exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt Diſſenters,) ſaid, <hi>In our Fathers days, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an People lived in perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before</hi> Luther<hi>'s New Goſpel</hi> —. But let us learn from our Reverend Father <hi>Jewel,</hi> that Unity of Faith may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101841:41"/>agree with Diverſity of Forms of Faith; and by Conſequence, with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Forms of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the Adminiſtration of God's Worſhip ought to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in one Nation; and variety of Rites in one National Church, would Cauſe Diviſion of Judgment, and by Conſequence Diviſion of Affection; and to tolerate divers ways of Adminiſtrations, would be to tolerate matter of perpetual Diſcord and Schiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides what the learned and acute Sir
<hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to a part of the matter of this Objection,

               <note place="margin">Account of Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, <hi>p. 8, 9.</hi>
               </note> I'll return my Anſwer in two things. 1. Without Controverſy, our Lord Jeſus took care for the Preſervation of Unity, ſuch a Unity as is neceſſary among his Diſciples; and yet took no ſuch Courſe as theſe Men build all Unity upon. 2. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was doubtleſs a particular Church, and according to the Senſe of the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> quoted before, there was no Form of Liturgy preſcribed, <hi>p.</hi> 619, 620.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, Multitudes of learned and able Men, living in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have diverſity of Apprehenſions and Notions of things, as well as in divers Nations; and except Uniformity of Words might produce an inward Uniformity of Conceptions, it hath not that Influence upon Unity as ſome Men think, by their too violent urging of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am for Uniformity according to General Rules, not excluding Prudence, which muſt judg what's neceſſary, what's expedient, what's edifying, or what not: for to exclude Prudence, is to limit Divine Providence to particular Rules. Divine Providence proceeds from Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; Prudence obſerves it, and Conſcience muſt obey it: Saving the Dominion of Providence, and the Exerciſe of Miniſterial Prudence, let's be as uniform as we can. This prudential Latitude is allowed to every Curate, in the choice of Homilies, in dividing them, leaving a part for the After-noon, and changing of Leſſons, reading one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſhall be moſt for Edification, in the Admonition to all Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Miniſters before the ſecond part of the Homily.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Queſtion; I deſire the violent and active, and the violent and oppreſſive Diſputants of theſe times, to anſwer, Whether they think that our Proteſtant-Diſſenting-Brethren, that preach the Faith, and labour to convert and build up precious Souls, are unworthy to enjoy Liberty to preach the Goſpel, or to enjoy their Eſtates, or to live
<hi>in any part of the World?</hi> If not, what ground have they for their ill Opinion? What Chriſtian Charity have they? How do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with Bloody Inquiſitors, and <hi>French</hi> Perſecutors! yea <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, and Inhuman Rooters out of Hereſy! But if not worthy to live among
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101841:42"/>us, retaining their Liberty of Conſcience and Religion, Whither ſhall they go? Where are they like to ſind more natural Affection, than among their Native Country-men and Acquaintance? Where ſhall they be more wel-come? among the Papiſts? among Infidels, where Satan bears ſo much Rule? or among Proteſtants abroad? Alas, where! who can entertain them? Would you baniſh them to <hi>Scotland, Ireland?</hi> there are too many already? Whither would you have them go (for they are bid begon, if they'll not conform, by ſome) where they may do good? there's work enough for them, where ever they are? Why may they not do good here among us? To be ſhort, they who turn them out of their Hearts, and Charity, upon the ſame reaſon baniſh them out of the Land, if not out of the World: And what if they ſhould ſay as their Ejectors do, We had better live or be in any Land or Nation, even among the Papiſts or Inſidels, than live among ſuch as theſe. Would it not ſound worſe than all that yet they have ſaid? And what a Diviſion, or Schiſm at the very root, would that be, if it grew to it? Which it hath not done, and I wiſh never may. But we may ſee that Violence is a Wedg to make the moſt ghaſtly Schiſm that ever was ſeen in a Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>But rather than be guilty of ſo unpeaceable and uncharitable a Thought or Carriage, capable of ſuch a Conſtruction, which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould as ill endure to lodg within them as the Devil himſelf, or expoſe our Brethren to Temptations and Sufferings; let us all moſt earneſtly pray for Peace and Union, and lay aſide all Thoughts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are the beginnings of Schiſm. And ſo I come to the laſt Query.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. Whether we ought not to unite as aboveſaid, and ſo to unite, and become one, by the removal or abating the things which divide and break us, ſo that we may hold mutual and actual Communion in the ſame Exerciſe of Religion, without fear of offending our Superiours or any other?</p>
            <p>That we ought to unite, is the Cry and Voice of all, in whom Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity doth but faintly breath, and the Spirit of God hath any effect or Intereſt; but the <hi>Quomodo</hi> is moſt difficult, in this, as in many other Operations. I have betrayed my ſelf, and diſcovered my poor Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the very Queſtion, by <hi>removing and abating the things which divide and break us.</hi> But it appears clear to my Apprehenſion, that no other way or means will ever do. If the Diſſenters ſhould be miraculouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, or charmed into a Conſent; then that which was a Cauſe of diſſent, is become as no Cauſe: and while their Underſtandings ſtand at this diſtance, and they be but ſincere and obedient, and honeſt to their own Thoughts and Judgments, they can never come over to us; and to uſe force without Reaſon, is the way to drive them from God, when we pretend to drive them to Church. Would we have them act againſt the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101841:42"/>ſettled Dictates of their Conſcience? and is Force the way to convince the Conſcience? And really what hath been offered to inform their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, hath been ineffectual to that End. Is it likely ſuch Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that convey neither Love nor diſtinctive Reaſonings, will ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men, better ſtudied in their own Caſe, than they that unite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? Is it likely that a diſplay of Words, and ſounding the Trumpets, not to call the Congregation together; to unite in Love and Peace, but to alarm People, to arm themſelves, and to watch as againſt Seditious Perſons, will ever incourage them to come in and unite with us? We muſt argue from better Topicks, than Sarcaſms, Flouts, Mockery, Emulation, Wrath and Reviling; theſe Deeds of the Fleſh will never allure Men to walk with us in one Spirit.</p>
            <p>There are large Encomiums of Unity and Peace, and every part of the Encomium, or praiſe of it, contains an Argument in perſwado us to it. And two mighty Arguments ſhould at this time prevail with us,<note n="*" place="margin">Since this was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I find the Right Reverend Biſhop of
<hi>Cork,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe theſe two Arguments <hi>in terminis,</hi> p. <hi>29.</hi> of the firſt (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent) Sermon.</note> Neceſſity, and Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; we ſee our apparent Dangers by being ſcattered abroad, like an Army in a Rout, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, or Tumult, while our Potent Enemies are united againſt us. We cry out upon Diſſenters as factious, but were it not for a Factious Spirit among our ſelves, they had never been thus broken and ſeparated from us. Our Life, our Delights, our Happineſs, doth conſiſt in, or ſpring from Union; after this our Deſires do run or fly, they move at no ſlower rate: Our Death, Sorrows, Griefs, and Unhappineſs doth follow our Separation from the things, wherein Life, Delight and Happineſs conſiſt. A divided State is an unhappy State; Charity is the Bond of Perfectneſs; when Charity dies, then the Church is like a Princely Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily broke up, diſperſed and divided. They who do not love, cannot unite, but make a Breach, and Separation. The uncharitable Man is the factious Man. <hi>To impute Factiouſneſs to one Party, who would unite, but cannot, and to excuſe another who may unite, but will not, is to judg with too apparent a Partiality for an equal Judg.</hi> Had the upper ſide, but the very ſame Reaſons and Arguments, which now the oppreſſed uſe and urge for themſelves, they would be of Authority, and very conſiderable, if not unanſwerable; whereas now they are look'd upon as weak, and ſcorned as ridiculous. Favour and Authority gives Force and Weight to the Reaſons of them that enjoy the benefit of the Favour; and when Perſons are expoſed to Contempt, their ſtrongeſt argnings are deſpiſed as weak, and their loudeſt Complaints are not heard, but rebuked as cauſeleſs, and themſelves branded as a Faction, tho they are Catholick and Loyal in their Faith and Principles. And this is plain, the
<hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:101841:43"/>have found it ſo; their Arguings, Repreſentations, Complaints (which have been but few) Motions, Supplications, Apologies have been deſpiſed, becauſe they are deſpiſed and low in the World, and a worldly Intereſt keeps them down. I have ſometimes thought, that if Authority had been againſt the uſe of the Croſs, and commanded Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> to write his Book againſt it, then he had been dignified with the Epithets, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath been adorned with, of the Judicious <hi>Parker,</hi> and the Profound <hi>Parker,</hi> and the Excellent <hi>Parker,</hi> whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the decried ſide, he hath been often laughed at. The greateſt number of Men conſider more the Condition of the Perſon, than the thing ſpoken or written by him; and give him the greateſt Honour, by whom they may receive a Favour. From this Partiality a Faction grows up and thrives exceedingly, when it is fatned by the Richneſs of the Soil, and influenced from ſome that ſit above; and hence it comes, even from Partiality and Faction, that the imputation of Faction is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly thrown upon Diſſenters, becauſe they do not what they cannot do with a good Conſcience according to their Light. But if all of us would ſet up God's Glory, the Edification of his Church, Truth, Peace, and Union in the middle as a Center, and all of us that are ſcattered and divided in the Circumference, run up to it, by the Lines of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Rules, then God would be more glorified than he is,<note place="margin">

Our Diverſity would be without Schiſm, and all our Diviſions would be like the diſperſing of a numerous Family without Alienation of Affection; like the Diſtribution of the Patriarchs into their ſeveral Tribes, inhabiting the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> all of the ſame Blood, the ſame Religion, in the ſame Covenant with God.</p>

            <p n="1">I. The Perſons united, are Chriſt and his Church, under the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Members, his Body, and his Spouſe, compared to ſeveral kinds of Union, as natural and political. Every Chriſtian is united to Chriſt by the Spirit of Chriſt's working Faith, and Faith perceiving, or ſeeing Chriſt to be what he is; and what he is, made of God to us, doth attract Love to him, which is intire, ſincere, fervent. By Faith and Love the renewed gracious Soul doth confederate with, and conſent, and ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Articles of the Goſpel, or Covenant of Grace. Every Member of Chriſt is a part of the whole, and there is the ſame Spirit in all, they are all Members of Chriſt, and Members one of another, and that Spirit, Faith and Love, which unites to Chriſt, doth unite them one to another. This Union is from active operating Principles and Graces, which are quickened, and ſtrengthened by the Spirit of Chriſt, making uſe commonly of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means and Ordinances to that End: And theſe Graces, or the New Man, ſo quickened and aſſiſted, exerciſe that Power towards Chriſt and one another; and this mutual Exerciſe of Grace, is our Communion with Chriſt, and his with us, and of one towards another, according to our various Conditions, in mutual Care, Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Compaſſion, and Joy. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26.</p>
            <p>This Communion with Chriſt, and one another, in this Life, is but imperfect, we underſtand but in part, and our Faith ſerves and helps us but in an imperfect State, and by Conſequence our Love is weak, and other Graces are at beſt but in a growing Condition. Our Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and Communnion in Ordinances have great Imperfections, according to the weakneſs of our Perceptions, Light and Judgment, and other Graces. And ſuppoſe our Love were ſtrong and intire to one another, yet in this bad Light, we are ſubject to many great Errors and Miſtakes: And our Union and Agreement lies, 1. In one general End, God's Glory. 2. In one Common Principle of Operation, or Efficient Cauſe, the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt. 3. In one way and means of Conveyance and Acceptation, Jeſus Chriſt, as our Mediator and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate. 4. In one General Rule, the Holy Scriptures, and the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Jeſus Chriſt the Law-giver; where there are theſe Ones, there is Catholick Unity: <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit; even as ye are called in one hope of your Calling; One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm; One God and Father of all, which is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> Epheſ. 4.4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ancient true Bonds of Unity, are one Faith, one Baptiſm, and not one Ceremony, one Polity, ſaith the Lord
<hi>Bacon;</hi>

               </note> our Diſagrement is in the latter, we agree in the firſt and principal.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:101841:44"/>
            <p>From this Union proceeds Communion; for, the Church, the Body of Chriſt, conſiſting of living Members, quickened by the renewing, ſanctifying Spirit, and exerciſing the Graces received, have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God through and by the Spirit; and with one another, as Children of the ſame Heavenly Father, and Subjects of the ſame Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King, and Members of the ſame Family. And this Communion is held, maintained, exerciſed, and increaſed by Laws and Ordinances, in the Obſervation of which, there is a conveyance of many and great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Benefits.</p>
            <p>This Union and Communion, is either inward or outward; inward, in being joined to the Lord, and to one another, in being of one Mind and Heart: Outward, and that's twofold: 1. In ſpiritual things. 2. In outward and carnal things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In ſpiritual things. So the firſt Church,
<hi>continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread and Prayers;</hi> Acts 2.42. <hi>And they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking of Bread from Houſe to Houſe, did eat their Meat with Gladneſs and Single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, praiſing God,</hi> &amp;c. Verſ. 46, 47. <hi>And let us conſider one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provoke unto Love and to good Works, not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhorting one another.</hi> Heb. 10.24, 25. <hi>Let the Word of God dwell in you richly, in all Wiſdom, admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 3.16. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting one another;</hi> Heb. 3.13. <hi>Comforting one another;</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.18. <hi>Edifying one another;</hi> Chap. 5.11.

            <p>It is ſaid, there can be no Union without Communion: be it ſo. Is not that Communion both of Churches, Paſtors and Perſons, a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Communion to free any Churches or Perſons from the Guilt of Schiſm, which is anſwerable and proportionable to the Union of the Body of Chriſt, and agreeable to the Inſtitutions and Ordinances of Chriſt? His Ordinances are ſufficient Means and Inſtances of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without any Additions of Forms and Ceremonies; we have his Law, and Form of Admiſſion into his Family and Church, Baptiſm: And being baptized by one Spirit into one Body; we have his Word, which is ſufficient to make us wiſe unto Salvation, and to make the Man of God perfect, throughly furniſhed unto every good Work; we have a Form and Pattern of Prayer, and Directions and Matter for all manner of Prayer; we have a Sacrament for Communion and Confirmation;

And it is obſerved, what the Spirit of Chriſt did to preſerve Unity, and prevent Schiſm. He gave diverſities of Gifts, for divers Adminiſtrations and Operations: The Church is compared to a Body, conſiſting of different Members, in Subordination, for Service and Uſefulneſs; ſome to do the Office of an Eye, others of an Ear; ſome of a Hand, others of a Foot; ſome honourable, and ſome diſhonourable, that there ſhould be no Schiſm in the Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. He inſpired holy Men, and they ſpake as inſpired by him, but not the ſame form of Words, without a great variety, not the ſame Form of Prayer in the ſame Words and Syllables; no not the ſame Form of Words to a word in the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Lord's Supper; St.
<hi>Mark</hi> leaves out, <hi>Drink ye all of it;</hi> Mark 14.23. <hi>and for Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> ver. 24. St. <hi>Luke</hi> adds to, <hi>This is my Body, given for you, Do this in Remembrance of me;</hi> Chap. 22.19, &amp; 20.
<hi>to the Cup, which is ſhed for you;</hi> and not as the other two Evangeliſts. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivers to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> what he received from the Lord, and adds to St. <hi>Matth.</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> and varies from St. <hi>Luke, This is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> and keeps the words of St. <hi>Luke, In Remembrance of me;</hi> but adding, <hi>As oft as ye do it in Remembrance of me,</hi> after the Cup; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11.23, 24. — If either of theſe Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles gave the Sacrament, uſing his own Words, and ſo it be delivered in four Forms; who will doubt but he holds Communion ſufficient to the Ends of the holy Sacrament? And the Uniformity lies in Bleſſing and giving Thanks, in taking Bread, breaking it, giving and taking it, as a Token of the Body of Chriſt to the appointed End; and ſo alſo the Cup, as a Token of his Blood, drinking it to the appointed End. Uniformity of Words is not neceſſary to Church-Communion, neither in Articles of Faith, nor in Preaching, nor in Prayer, nor in Sacraments; and yet Church-Communion is as neceſſary a Duty, as aſſociating of Churches and Aſſemblies, it being truly the End of ſuch Aſſociation and Aſſembling: And yet no Man of ſenſe will deny the great Advantages of Conſent, Agreement, Similitude, and Uniformity in all our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, as near as we can frame our Minds thereunto, which will never come nearer than according to general Rules, without Debates and Diſputes, as many, if not more, and of as great an Influence upon Peace, as can ariſe from the Application and Conſtruction of General Rules.</p>

            <p>Find out, firſt, what Unity is neceſſary for this imperfect State. 2. Obſerve what Rules Chriſt gave by his Spirit, and the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles practiſed for Unity, againſt Schiſm, for Truth and Faith againſt Hereſy, for Government againſt Confuſion, for Order againſt Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for Decency againſt Indecency, for Worſhip againſt Idolatry and Irreligion, for Diſcipline againſt decay of Piety, and for the ſoundneſs of its Members; in a word, for Admiſſion into Communion and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, for Edification, Peace, and Comfort: And what more can be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Unity and Peace of Chriſtians in one Nation, than what was ſufficient for Chriſtians in all Nations? And then there will be neither Schiſm on one hand, nor Diſſent on the other. That one Rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, as far as we have attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, would unite and heal us, and do us more Service than all the Volumns of Canons
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101841:46"/>beſides. And who can walk by the ſame Rule further than he hath attained?</p>
            <p>The Means to be uſed for Union, are 1. A ſincere Obſervation of, and conſciencious Conſent unto the Terms of our Chriſtianity and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, our Baptiſmal Vow. Hypocrites and Formaliſts, are the firſt Rank of Diſſenters, and Schiſmaticks, that conform not unto the Laws of Chriſt, and Terms of Salvation. 2. A conſcientious walking after the Spirit. Senſual Men, that have not the Spirit, are the notorious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts. 3. A ſtudious ſearch into, and keeping to the holy Goſpel, wherein we are taught, as the way to Union.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſetting up, or rather acknowledgment of God, <hi>as in all, and above all;</hi> 1 Cor. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An Imitation of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. in Humbleneſs of Mind and Condeſcention.</p>

By Charity which ſuffereth long, is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puſſed up, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, thinketh none Evil, rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but rejoyceth in the Truth. By theſe Divine Effects and Properties of Charity, we may lay our Diviſions upon the Head of Uncharitableneſs: Charity keeps all together as in a Bond of Perfectneſs: <hi>Be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly Love, in Honour preferring one another:</hi> Rom.

            <p n="5">5. By Self-denial. This is the individual Property and Effect of true Faith and Love, and by Conſequence the neceſſary Qualification of a Diſciple. By this we ſeek God's Glory, and not our own; pray that <hi>God's Kingdom may come, and his Will be done;</hi> as if we had no Intereſt nor Concernment in this World, but the Advancement of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nor Work to do, but to do his Will. Except we deny our ſelves we cannot condeſcend, not ſeek the good of all, but pleaſe our ſelves; we cannot have a Care of one another as of our ſelves; we ſhall not ſeek the things that be of Chriſt, but our own. This Factious, this Schima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Self muſt be denied, or we can never be healed, nor grow in one.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If we would unite, we muſt not aggravate Diviſions, nor multiply Schiſms in our own Fancies, Opinions and uncharitable Affections, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon diverſity of Opinions, as hideous Errors; upon Errors as damnable; judging others as Deceivers, and deceived, and admiring our ſelves, as if priviledged with a little Infallibility; cenſuring our Brethren, reviling, reproaching, ſuppreſſing and perſecuting of them.

            </p>
            <p>Here's the Nature of eulpable Separation opened. 1. It is a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Communion of Saints. 2. Communion of Sains approved by the Apoſtles Rules. 3. Combination in a new Brotherhood. 4. The Reaſon of ſuch Separation, and Combination, accounting the Chriſtians who are conformable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be profane and unmeet for them to joyn with, in Chriſtian Profeſſion. The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> both of Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Presbyterian and Congregational, do declare, 1. That they believe, and hold Communion of Saints. 2. That the Apoſtle's Rules are the Rules of that Communion. 3. That conforming Miniſters and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are true Churches, a true and excellent part of the Catholick Church. 4. That they ſeparate not from any Chriſtians, becauſe they are, or that are
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> conformable to the Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is not a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Chriſtian in <hi>England,</hi> or in the whole World, but they that are ſincere Chriſtians among them, do and muſt hold Communion with them
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101841:47"/>in the Chriſtian Profeſſion. The Reaſon of their Combinations, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome Injunctions required of them alien from the Apoſtles Rules; as we are Chriſtians, and keep to the Apoſtles Rules, they do not judg us to be unmeet for Chriſtian Profeſſion with them. As this is clear from the declared Doctrines of the
<hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> ſo it is clear in the Practice of many of them, as more than my ſelf can teſtify, who have had of them, communicate in Prayer, Preaching and Sacraments with us. There may be ſome, who ignorantly, weakly and paſſionately, upon Prejudice and Unacquaintance, may be too far eſtranged from us, but as many of theſe as are Chriſtians, dare not withdraw from Chriſtian-Communion with us; or judg us unmeet for Chriſtian Profeſſion with them; theſe are to be pittied and rectified; but if they believe with the Heart, and confeſs with the Mouth Jeſus Chriſt; the Schiſm is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal and oral, but not fundamental, and in the Heart. A Man may be ſhy of another Man's Company, through Unacquaintance and Suſpition, but if he will not keep the ſame Pace, or the ſame Track in the way to Heaven, I'll own him for a Fellow-Traveller, if I ſee him go on in the beaten Path of Chriſtianity, tho not hand in hand with me. If he ſuſpect me for a Robber, I'll aſſure him of my Honeſty if I can, that we have the Comfort of good Company, There are not ſo many that declare themſelves bound for Heaven, that I muſt cut off them that do; becauſe we have ſome Jars and Diſputations upon our Journey—. Let us learn Moderation from the higheſt Fathers of the Church in their days, and learn this <hi>Canonical Notion</hi> of a Schiſmatick. A Schiſmatick from the Church, is, <hi>He that ſeparates from the Communion of Saints, according to the Apoſtles Rules, as from Chriſtians unmeet for Chriſtian Profeſſion, becauſe they conform;</hi> i. e. <hi>as from no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but prophane, becauſe they conform to the Doctrine, Government, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Agreeable with this, is that Deſcription of Schiſm given us by that clear and very learned Dr. <hi>Barnaby Potter,</hi> (<hi>Anſwer to Charity miſtaken,</hi> Sect. 3. p. 76.)
<q rend="margQuotes">Whoſoever profeſſes himſelf to forſake the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any one Member of the Body of Chriſt, muſt confeſs himſelf conſequently to forſake the whole. And therefore her Communion we forſake not no more than the Body of Chriſt, whereof we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a Member, tho corrupted. And this clears us from the Imputation of Schiſm, <hi>whoſe Property it is,</hi> (witneſs the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> and <hi>Luciferians</hi>) to cut off from the Body of Chriſt, and the hope of Salvation, the Church from which it ſeparates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, when the Juſuit-Knot frames an Argument from this Deſcription of Schiſm; the Rational Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> denies the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm; ſaying, it is all one as to prove, that becauſe a Man hath a Feaver,
<pb facs="tcp:101841:47"/>therefore he hath the Plague; and makes this to be but one Property of a Schiſm. But be it ſo, if this be a Vindication of the Proteſtants from being Schiſmaticks, becauſe of our Separation from
<hi>Rome;</hi> it will as clearly vindicate our Proteſtant
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> from the charge of Schiſm, from the Eſtabliſhed Church, for they do not cut off from the Body of Chriſt and hope of Salvation, the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Indeed, the Separation with which they are charged, is not from it, as from a Church, but as Separation in a Church, fundamentally and eſſentially the ſame, but differing in Accidents and Modes, which muſt needs be the loweſt kind of Difference, and not comparable to that in <hi>Corinth;</hi> which our Famous Dr.

<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are all one in Chriſt; none of the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> have been ever heard to divide, and cry, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our impoſed Accidents are the dividing things among us. And certainly, if the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> do ſin grievouſly, in refuſing Communion with us in them, agreeing in all the Parts of Chriſtian Catholick Communion with us; It will be a remarkable Act of Charity and Goodneſs in our Governours to deliver them from ſo great a Sin, by reducing the fore-quoted Doctrine of our Church, in the Homily of Faſting, into Practice; for thoſe be the things, at which they ſtumble, it will be a Charity to take them out of the way: Or if they will not remove them, then I'll conclude, it is hard to call them Schiſmaticks, who are all one with us, as far as we are all one with all Reformed and Chriſtian Churches, remembring the Words of the Learned Dr.
